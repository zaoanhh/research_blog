## Background


ISAC has been conceptualized, designed, and optimized for making communication and sensing functions complementary to each other.
The different goals bring the inherent [trade-off]{.alert} between communication and sensing performance when integrating them together.

## Motivation

::: {.callout-note}
## The ISAC system can be formulated by 

$$\mathbf{Y}=\mathbf{H}\mathbf{X}+\mathbf{N},$$

 where $\mathbf{Y}$ is the received signal, $\mathbf{X}$ is the transmitted signal, $\mathbf{H}$ is the channel status, and $\mathbf{N}$ is the noise that might be introduced by sensed objects.
:::

Intuitively, the system sensing capability can be evaluated by analyzing how the received signals reflect the channel status, such as sensing [mutual information]{.alert} $I(\mathbf{H};\mathbf{Y})$.

## Motivation

#### Howerve, it doesn’t work well for the following two reasons.

- The relationship between the sensing capability of such features and the signal itself is ambiguous.

- The sensing capability analysis must be designed to operate for all possible types.

# What do we do?

In this paper, we propose a general sensing channel encoder model to help determine the sensing capability – the upper
bound and lower bound of error in restoring the sensed object from given wireless signal features.

## Model definitions

A typical sensing process often comprises several components: the [target status]{.alert} to be sensed ($W$), the [feature]{.alert} ($X^n$) designed to sense the status, the sensing [channel embedding]{.alert} ($Y^n$) obtained through the sensing system, and the [result]{.alert} ($\hat{W}$) derived after processing the signal.

## Model definitions

## DTMI
The discrete task mutual information (DTMI) is defined as the mutual information between the feature $X^n$ and the channel embedding $Y^n$, i.e., $I(X^n;Y^n)$.

:::{.callout-note}
## Conditional error probability
The conditional error probability  $\xi _i$ when the target status is $w_i$ is defined as:
	$$
		\xi _i = \Pr(\hat{W}\neq w_i|W=w_i).
		\label{eq:lambda_i}
	$$

## Expected value of the error
The expected value of the error, denoted as $P_E^{n}$, is articulated as follows:
	$$
		P_E^{n} = \sum_{i=1}^{m} p(w_i)\xi _i.
		\label{eq:error}
	$$
:::
:::

## Bound

:::{#imp-lowbound .callout-important}
### Lower bound
For a sensing task $W$ with $m$ statuses, we use $n$ independent features to describe the status of the target.
	The expected value of the error $P_E^{n}$ satisfies the following lower bound:
	$$
		P_E^{n}+ \frac{H(P_E^n)}{\log m}\geq \frac{H(W)-I(X^n;Y^n)}{\log m},
		\label{eq:lowbound}
	$$
	where $H(P_E^n)=-P_E^n \log P_E^n - (1-P_E^n)\log(1-P_E^n)$.
:::

:::{#imp-upbound .callout-important}
### Up bound

For a sensing task with $m$ statuss, we use $n$ independent features to describe the status of the target.
	For sufficiently large $n$, the expected value of the error $P_E^{n}$ satisfies the following upper bound:
	$$
		P_E^{n}\leq \varepsilon + \sum_{k=1}^m p(w_k) \sum_{j\neq k}^m 2^{3n\varepsilon-\sum_{i=1}^n I(X_i(w_j);Y_i(w_k))}
		\label{eq:upbound}
	$$

# Corollary

Previous excellent sensing systems have summarized many valuable experiences, such as multi-modal systems tend to achieve better sensing [performance]{.alert}. However, these experiences currently lack theoretical explainability. In this section, we employ sensing channel encoder model and DTMI as tools to attempt to [explain]{.alert} some classic phenomena.

## Why do multimodal systems tend to exhibit superior performance?

Many previous research works have shown that using multi-modality for sensing helps achieve better performance, which can be explained by the theorem we proved previously.

## How do we compare which of two sensing features is better?

In this paper, we propose [DTMI]{.alert} which can reflect the performance of sensing features to a certain extent.
Specifically, we consider two features $X$ and $X'$.
After passing through the sensing channel, their corresponding channel embeddings are $Y$ and $Y'$, respectively.
According to @imp-lowbound and @imp-upbound, both the upper and lower bounds of the expected error are related to the DTMI.
If the DTMI $I(X;Y)>I(X';Y')$, the upper and lower bounds of the expected value of the error $P_E$ will be reduced, which means that it is easier to achieve good performance using $X$ as sensing features.

[This necessitates alternative approaches, beyond experimental validation, to assess the performance of designed sensing features.]{.alert}

## Is data pre-processing a "cure-all" solution?


If the following equation holds,
$$
        H(W)-I(X^n;D^l) > 1,
$$
lossless sensing cannot be achieved simply by improving the effect of data preprocessing.
