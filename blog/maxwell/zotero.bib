For this, BaTiO3 powder by oxide route and polyaniline by chemical oxidation route have been synthesized. The complex permittivity ({$\varepsilon\prime$}r-j{$\varepsilon{''}$}r) and reflection loss (dB) of the composites have been measured at different microwave frequencies in X-band (8.2--12.4GHz) employing vector network analyzer model PNA E8364B and software module 85071. Reflection loss (dB) has been calculated for different thicknesses of the composites using measured values of {$\varepsilon\prime$}r and {$\varepsilon{''}$}r. It is found that the absorption properties of the composite improve with increasing \% of polyaniline. A maximum reflection loss of -15dB (97\% power absorption) at 10GHz with a bandwidth of 3GHz (full frequency width at half of the peak response) has been achieved. Materials can find applications in suppression of electromagnetic interference (EMI), and reduction of radar signature.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a comparative study is performed between the most eminent computational geometry based surface reconstruction algorithms. These algorithms are the Crust, the Power Crust, the Tight Cocone and the Ball Pivoting algorithm. The key issues for the comparison are the quality of the reconstructed surface, the reconstruction time, and the total memory usage. To guarantee a proper comparison, the algorithms were implemented using the same programming tools and tested on the same platform. Several benchmark test cases were used to validate the implemented algorithms. The Crust and Power Crust algorithms showed a balanced trade-off between execution time and memory usage. The Ball Pivoting algorithm exhibited minimum execution time and memory usage, followed by the Tight Cocone. The experiments showed that applying any of the four algorithms on a non-uniformly distributed cloud may create poor quality surface. To deal with such clouds, an enhanced algorithm based on Ball Pivoting algorithm and Radial Basis Functions is proposed. The enhanced algorithm has the capability of filling any detected hole within the surface reconstruction process. The proposed algorithm exhibited high robustness in reconstructing objects with non-uniform sampling and misregistrations.},

  abstract = {RFID and WiFi backscatter systems use similar techniques to enable battery-free wireless communication. Despite their similarities, existing WiFi backscatter systems achieve a much shorter range than RFID systems. The main reason for this limitation is self-interference. In particular, in any backscatter communication, the reader needs to transmit and receive at the same time. RFID systems do this by using full-duplex hardware. Unfortunately, existing WiFi devices do not have full-duplex capabilities. Therefore, to enable backscatter communication using existing WiFi devices, today's WiFi backscatter systems use two WiFi devices where one transmits and the other one receives. However, since the tag's reflection is very weak compared to the query signal, it is very challenging to detect and extract the tag's reflection from the query signal. This problem is known as self-interference. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for eliminating this problem in WiFi backscatter systems without any hardware modifications on existing WiFi devices. Our empirical evaluations show that our technique improves the range of in-channel WiFi backscatter systems to that of RFID in both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight scenarios. Moreover, our approach enables WiFi backscatter communication even in scenarios where the tag has no LOS path to any WiFi device. None of existing WiFi backscatter systems work in this scenario.},

  abstract = {WiFi backscatter communication has the potential to enable battery-free sensors which can transmit data using a WiFi network. In order for WiFi backscatter systems to be practical they should be compatible with existing WiFi networks without any hardware or software modifications. Moreover, they should work with networks that use encryption. In this paper, we present WiTAG which achieves these requirements, making the implementation and deployment of WiFi backscatter communication more practical. In contrast with existing systems which utilize the physical layer for backscatter communication, we take a different approach by leveraging features of the MAC layer to communicate. WiTAG is designed to send data by selectively interfering with subframes (MPDUs) in an aggregated frame (A-MPDU). This enables standard compliant communication using modern, open or encrypted 802.11n and 802.11ac networks without requiring hardware or software modifications to any devices. We implement WiTAG using off-the-shelf components and evaluate its performance in line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight scenarios. We show that WiTAG achieves a throughput of up to 4 Kbps without impacting other devices in the network.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The trajectory localisation of human activities using signal analytics has become a reality due to the widespread use of advanced signal processing systems. Device-free localisation using WiFi devices is prevalent, and the received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and channel state information (CSI) signals offer additional benefits. However, radio frequency (RF) localisation is highly dependent on the environment, so updating fingerprint data is necessary by changing the environment. This work presents Fine-grained Indoor Detection and Angular Radar for recognising and locating humans using a multipath trajectory reflections system that does not require training. It estimates location using a probabilistic approach that considers changes in CSI and RSSI across multiple nodes, generating an informative dataset that reflects the current trajectory and status of the location. The presented method extracts data from clustered Raspberry Pi 4B and Nexmon. The method exhibits a versatile real-time location-tracking solution by utilising the distinctive properties of RF signals. This technology has significant implications for various applications, including human medical monitoring, gaming, smart cities, and optimising building layouts to improve efficiency. The model demonstrates location-independent localisation with up to 80\% accuracy in mapping trajectories at any location. The findings indicate that the proposed model is effective and reliable for indoor localisation and activity tracking, making it a promising solution for implementation in real-world environments.},

In this paper, we ask whether it is possible for smart environments to monitor our vital signs remotely, without instrumenting our bodies. We introduce Vital-Radio, a wireless sensing technology that monitors breathing and heart rate without body contact. Vital-Radio exploits the fact that wireless signals are affected by motion in the environment, including chest movements due to inhaling and exhaling and skin vibrations due to heartbeats. We describe the operation of Vital-Radio and demonstrate through a user study that it can track users' breathing and heart rates with a median accuracy of 99\%, even when users are 8{\textasciitilde}meters away from the device, or in a different room. Furthermore, it can monitor the vital signs of multiple people simultaneously. We envision that Vital-Radio can enable smart homes that monitor people's vital signs without body instrumentation, and actively contribute to their inhabitants' well-being.},

RF-Capture tracks the 3D positions of a person's limbs and body parts even when the person is fully occluded from its sensor, and does so without placing any markers on the subject's body. In designing RF-Capture, we built on recent advances in wireless research, which have shown that certain radio frequency (RF) signals can traverse walls and reflect off the human body, allowing for the detection of human motion through walls. In contrast to these past systems which abstract the entire human body as a single point and find the overall location of that point through walls, we show how we can reconstruct various human body parts and stitch them together to capture the human figure. We built a prototype of RF-Capture and tested it on 15 subjects. Our results show that the system can capture a representative human figure through walls and use it to distinguish between various users.},

Despite advances in underwater imaging, most of the ocean and marine organisms remain unobserved and undiscovered. Existing methods for underwater imaging are unsuitable for scalable, long-term, in situ observations because they require tethering for power and communication. Here we describe underwater backscatter imaging, a method for scalable, real-time wireless imaging of underwater environments using fully-submerged battery-free cameras. The cameras power up from harvested acoustic energy, capture color images using ultra-low-power active illumination and a monochrome image sensor, and communicate wirelessly at net-zero-power via acoustic backscatter. We demonstrate wireless battery-free imaging of animals, plants, pollutants, and localization tags in enclosed and open-water environments. The method's self-sustaining nature makes it desirable for massive, continuous, and long-term ocean deployments with many applications including marine life discovery, submarine surveillance, and underwater climate change monitoring.},

  abstract = {Backscattering tags transmit passively without an on-board active radio transmitter. Almost all present-day backscatter systems, however, rely on active radio receivers. This presents a significant scalability, power and cost challenge for backscatter systems. To overcome this barrier, recent research has empowered these passive tags with the ability to reliably receive backscatter signals from other tags. This forms the building block of passive networks wherein tags talk to each other without an active radio on either the transmit or receive side. For wider functionality, accurate localization of such tags is critical. All known backscatter tag localization techniques rely on active receivers for measuring and characterizing the received signal. As a result, they cannot be directly applied to passive tag-to-tag networks. This paper overcomes the gap by developing a localization technique for such passive networks based on a novel method for phase-based ranging in passive receivers. This method allows pairs of passive tags to collaboratively determine the inter-tag channel phase while effectively minimizing the effects of multipath and noise in the surrounding environment. Building on this, we develop a localization technique that benefits from large link diversity uniquely available in a passive tag-to-tag network. We evaluate the performance of our techniques with extensive micro-benchmarking experiments in an indoor environment using fabricated prototypes of tag hardware. We show that our phase-based ranging performs similar to active receivers, providing median 1D ranging error {$<$}1 cm and median localization error also {$<$}1 cm. Benefiting from the large-scale link diversity our localization technique outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques that use active receivers.},

Given that the existing HCI approaches exhibit various limitations, hand gesture recognition-based HCI may serve as a more natural mode of man--machine interaction in many situations. Inspired by an inception module-based deep-learning network (GoogLeNet), this paper presents a novel hand gesture recognition technique for impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radars which demonstrates a higher gesture recognition accuracy. First, methodology to demonstrate radar signals as three-dimensional image patterns is presented and then, the inception module-based variant of GoogLeNet is used to analyze the pattern within the images for the recognition of different hand gestures. The proposed framework is exploited for eight different hand gestures with a promising classification accuracy of 95\%. To verify the robustness of the proposed algorithm, multiple human subjects were involved in data acquisition.},

A dictionary of radar waveforms is used at each transmitter and the communication information is embedded in the radar waveform by exploiting waveform diversity. The proposed strategy can serve multiple communication receivers located in the vicinity of the distributed DFRC MIMO system. Simulation results illustrate the performance of the proposed strategy.},

To better understand the privacy concerns regarding the disclosure of background objects to different types of human assistants (friends, family, and others), we conducted an online survey with 155 visually impaired participants. In general, our participants had varying concerns depending on the type of assistants and the kind of information. We found that our participants were more concerned about the privacy of bystanders than their own when capturing people in images. We also found that participants were concerned about self-presentation and were more comfortable sharing embarrassing information with family than with their friends. Our findings suggest directions for future work in the development of human-assisted question-answering systems. Specifically, we discuss how humanizing these systems can give people a greater sense of personal security.},

Current trace-driven simulators assume that the interventions being simulated (e.g., a new algorithm) would not affect the validity of the traces. However, real-world traces are often biased by the choices algorithms make during trace collection, and hence replaying traces under an intervention may lead to incorrect results. CausalSim addresses this challenge by learning a causal model of the system dynamics and latent factors capturing the underlying system conditions during trace collection. It learns these models using an initial randomized control trial (RCT) under a fixed set of algorithms, and then applies them to remove biases from trace data when simulating new algorithms.},

  abstract = {Deep learning (DL)-based semantic segmentation methods have been providing state-of-the-art performance in the past few years. More specifically, these techniques have been successfully applied in medical image classification, segmentation, and detection tasks. One DL technique, U-Net, has become one of the most popular for these applications. We propose a recurrent U-Net model and a recurrent residual U-Net model, which are named RU-Net and R2U-Net, respectively. The proposed models utilize the power of U-Net, residual networks, and recurrent convolutional neural networks. There are several advantages to using these proposed architectures for segmentation tasks. First, a residual unit helps when training deep architectures. Second, feature accumulation with recurrent residual convolutional layers ensures better feature representation for segmentation tasks. Third, it allows us to design better U-Net architectures with the same number of network parameters with better performance for medical image segmentation. The proposed models are tested on three benchmark datasets, such as blood vessel segmentation in retinal images, skin cancer segmentation, and lung lesion segmentation. The experimental results show superior performance on segmentation tasks compared to equivalent models, including a variant of a fully connected convolutional neural network called SegNet, U-Net, and residual U-Net.},

Raw audio signals collected through these devices contain a host of sensitive paralinguistic information (e.g., emotional patterns) that is transmitted to service providers regardless of deliberate or false triggers. We thus encounter a new generation of privacy risks by using these services. To tackle this issue, we have developed EDGY; a configurable, lightweight, disentangled representation learning framework that transforms and filters high-dimensional voice data to identify and selectively filter sensitive attributes at the edge prior to offloading to the cloud. Our results show that EDGY runs in tens of milliseconds with 0.2\% relative improvement in ABX score and minimal performance penalties in learning linguistic representations from raw signals on a CPU and single-core ARM processor with no specialized hardware.},

  abstract = {A RFID-based Indoor Location System (ILS) that makes use of Received Signal Strength (RSS) information is presented. The proposed system is derived from a simple Direction Finder (DF) consisting on two antennas one tilted to respect to the other, so that their radiation patterns partially overlap. RFID tags are attached to the person or asset to be tracked. The ratio between RSS values received on each antenna is used to estimate the Angle of Arrival (AoA) of the electromagnetic signals backscattered by RFID tags. Once the AoA is estimated, the absolute RSS values are compared against a free-space propagation model to obtain an estimate of the range or distance. Then, given the AoA and the range, the position of the RFID tags can be obtained. The proposed system, based on a single DF unit, is tested in three real indoor scenarios: the first example is devoted to evaluating the agreement between the theoretical and experimental characterization of the DF system, in terms of the radiation patterns of its antennas as well as the position estimation accuracy within the coverage area, thereby analyzing the robustness of AoA against multipath. Second example shows simple cases of asset tracking, and the third one presents an enhanced system comprising two sets of antennas that improves positioning accuracy. A comparison with state-of-the-art ILS is also presented, in order to put the proposed RFID-based ILS into context.},

Nevertheless, the high-power costs of communication per distance unit lead to poor technical solutions, particularly in terms of flexibility and efficiency. A future of devices connected through an Internet of Things (IoT) network will require billions of sensors that will affect costs and increase the energy requirements if not equipped with backscattering technologies such as RFID. This work shows how a quantum tunneling RFID tag enables the use of RFIDs in new applications by minimizing battery waste and by drastically improving the range of backscattering systems. The highly sensitive 5.8 GHz quantum tunneling RFID tag achieves backscattering free space ranges above 1.2 km while consuming biasing powers as low as 20.4 {$\mu$}W. This is over 10 times higher than the maximum range of a semi-passive 5.8 GHz RFID ideal link. The quantum tunneling tag is characterized by return gains as high as 35 dB, a simple RF front-end, a sensitivity of -84 dBm, and increasing SNRs for increasing RF impinging powers. This work lays out the basis for both entrepreneurial and research activities that will lead to a new class of long-range backscattering passive sensors with power consumption far lower than traditional radios.},

The phaseless reconstruction is highly nonlinear and much more severely ill-posed. Algorithms are provided to solve both the phased and the phaseless reconstructions in the linearized case. Stability is studied by estimating the condition number of the inversion process for both the phased and the phaseless cases. An optimal strategy is suggested to attain the infimum of the condition numbers of the phaseless reconstruction, which may provide an important guidance for efficient phaseless measurements in practical applications. To the best of our knowledge, the stability analysis in terms of condition numbers is new for the phased and phaseless inverse scattering problems and is very important to help us understand the degree of ill-posedness of these inverse problems. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the theoretical asymptotic behavior, as well as the effectiveness and robustness of the phaseless reconstruction algorithm.},

These standards have been widely adopted for many applications, such as mobile payments, advertisements, social sharing, admission control, and so on. Recently, considerable demands require the integration of these two codes (barcode and NFC code) into a single tag for the functional complementation. To achieve the goal of "one tag, two codes" (OTTC), this work proposes CoilCode, which takes advantage of the printed electronics to fuse an NFC coil antenna into a QR code on a single layer. The proposed code could be identified by cameras and NFC readers. With the use of the conductive inks, QR code and NFC code have become an essential part of each other: the modules of the QR code facilitate the NFC chip in harvesting energy from the magnetic field, while the NFC antenna itself represents bits of the QR code. Compared to the prior dual-layer OTTC, CoilCode is more compact, cost-effective, flimsy, flexible, and environment-friendly, and also reduces the fabrication complexity considerably. We prototyped hundreds of CoilCodes and conducted comprehensive evaluations (across 4 models of NFC chips and 8 kinds of NFC readers under 13 different system configurations). CoilCode demonstrates high-quality identification results for QR code and NFC functions on a wide range of inputs and under different distortion effects.},

By comparing the generated data samples against outputs from classical solvers, we assess their accuracy and examine their adherence to the underlying physics laws. In this way, we emphasize the importance of not only satisfying visual and statistical comparisons with solver data but also ensuring the generated data's conformity to physics laws, thus enabling their effective utilization in downstream tasks.},

An accurate estimate of rainfall levels is fundamental in smart city application scenarios: it becomes essential to be able to warn of the imminent occurrence of a calamitous event and reduce the risk to human beings. Unfortunately, to date, traditional techniques for rainfall level estimation present numerous critical issues. This paper proposes a new approach to rainfall classification based on the LTE radio channel parameters adopted for the cell selection mechanism. In particular, this study highlights the correlation between the set of radio channel quality monitoring parameters and the relative rainfall intensity levels. Through a pattern recognition approach based on neural networks with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), the proposed algorithm identifies five classes of rainfall levels with an average accuracy of 96 \% and a F1 score of 93.6 \%.},

  abstract = {Reliable simulation analysis requires accurately calibrating input model parameters. While there has been a sizable literature on parameter calibration that utilizes directly observed data, much less attention has been paid to the situation where only output-level data are available to justify input parameter choices. This latter problem, which is known as the inverse problem and relates to the model validation literature, involves several new challenges, one of which is the non-identifiability issue. In this paper we introduce the concept of eligibility set to bypass non-identifiability, by relaxing the need of consistent estimation to obtaining bounds on the input parameter values. We reason this concept from the worst-case notion in robust optimization, and demonstrate how to compute eligibility set via empirical matching between the simulated and the real outputs. We substantiate our procedure with theoretical error analysis and validate its effectiveness via numerical experiments.},

  abstract = {The wireless signal propagates via multipath arising from different reflections and penetration between a transmitter and receiver. Extracting multipath profiles (e.g., delay and Doppler along each path) from received signals enables many important applications, such as channel prediction and crossband channel estimation (i.e., estimating the channel on a different frequency). The benefit of multipath estimation further increases with mobility since the channel in that case is less stable and more important to track. Yet high-speed mobility poses significant challenges to multipath estimation. In this paper, instead of using time-frequency domain channel representation, we leverage the delay-Doppler domain representation to accurately extract and predict multipath properties. Specifically, we use impulses in the delay-Doppler domain as pilots to estimate the multipath parameters and apply the multipath information to predicting wireless channels as an example application. Our design rationale is that mobility is more predictable than the wireless channel since mobility has inertial while the wireless channel is the outcome of a complicated interaction between mobility, multipath, and noise. We evaluate our approach via both acoustic and RF experiments, including vehicular experiments using USRP. Our results show that the estimated multipath matches the ground truth, and the resulting channel prediction is more accurate than the traditional channel prediction schemes.},

Systems that use different frequency bands for uplink and downlink communication often need feedback between devices to exchange band specific channel information. The current state-of-the-art approach proposes a way to predict the channel in the downlink based on that of the observed uplink by identifying variables underlying the uplink channel. In this paper we present a solution that greatly reduces the complexity of this task, and is even applicable for single antenna devices. Our approach uses a neural network trained on a standard channel model to generate coarse estimates for the variables underlying the channel. We then use a simple and efficient single antenna optimization framework to get more accurate variable estimates, which can be used for downlink channel prediction. We implement our approach on software defined radios and compare it to the state-of-the-art through experiments and simulations. Results show that our approach reduces the time complexity by at least an order of magnitude (10x), while maintaining similar prediction quality.},

The relation between the permittivity of the fiber material and that of the air-fiber mixture in a fabric form belongs to a more general problem of dielectric mixtures which has been studied for more than 100 years. This paper reviews many such dielectric mixture formulas available today and applies them for the case of a woven fabric made from monofilament yarns of high density polyethylene. At the low fiber volume fraction which is typical for any woven fabric, the dispersion of values given by different mixing equations lies between 2.028 and 2.400. An extrapolation technique using a quadratic equation also gives a reasonable value which falls in the above range.},

Artificial Intelligence (AI) models are commonly regarded as the cornerstone for NI design, as they have proven extremely successful at solving hard problems that require inferring complex relationships from entangled, massive (network traffic) data. However, the common approach of plugging `vanilla' AI models into controllers and orchestrators does not fulfil the potential of the technology. Instead, AI models should be tailored to the specific network level and respond to the specific needs of network functions, eventually coordinated by an end-to-end NI-native architecture for 6G. In this paper, we discuss these challenges and provide results for a candidate NI-driven functionality that is properly integrated into the proposed architecture: network capacity forecasting.},

One of the most promising features of LoRa is the ability to track the location of radios from a distance, enabling applications ranging from inventory tracking, smart infrastructure monitoring and structural health sensing. Yet, state-of-the-art LoRa localization systems experience errors of several tens or even hundreds of meters in location tracking, owing to the narrow bandwidth and limited battery life of LoRa devices. This paper presents OwLL, a LoRa localization system that limits location error to few meters with commodity LoRa clients in a wide-area network. Our key innovation is the development of a distributed base station network made of individually low-cost components that together span a wide bandwidth that encompasses the TV whitespaces and offers high aperture, crucial to localization accuracy. We demonstrate how this network can aggregate signal measurements made across multiple different narrowband channels of a LoRa client to triangulate it at fine accuracy. We implement and evaluate OwLL on a testbed spanning a large university campus centered in a major U.S. city and demonstrate a 9 m (across line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight) median error in localization.},

While researchers often assume that their definition of ``privacy'' is universally held by all readers, this is rarely the case; so many papers addressing key challenges in this domain have actually produced results that do not consider the same problem, even when using similar vocabularies. This paper provides an explicit definition of data privacy suitable for ongoing work in data repositories such as a DBMS or for data mining. The work contributes by briefly providing the larger context for the way privacy is defined legally and legislatively but primarily provides a taxonomy capable of thinking of data privacy technologically. We then demonstrate the taxonomy's utility by illustrating how this perspective makes it possible to understand the important contribution made by researchers to the issue of privacy. The conclusion of this paper is that privacy is indeed multifaceted so no single current research effort adequately addresses the true breadth of the issues necessary to fully understand the scope of this important issue.},

The real-time realization and quick installation of UAV networks make it extremely suitable for emergency services. Due to limited energy and processing memory, vSDN-enabled UAV networks are brought into the picture where the central SDN controller is used to manage the Data Plane UAV activities. The placement of the controller is a critical issue due to random mobility and distant coverage. In this work, we have proposed a controller implantation technique for low latency communication and service delivery. A two-tier hierarchical data plane (D-plane) segmentation has been introduced to place the UAV entities at D-plane. Our algorithmic approach shows that the centralization of SDN controller causes comparatively low latency with respect to other potential regions. We have relaxed the traffic overheads considering minimal data exchange between D-plane and C-plane. The latency trade-off significantly helps to identify the most suitable positions to deploy the Controller units. This work also contributes towards the CPP-UAV (Controller Placement Problem in UAV-networks).},

In the first, a deterministic target impulse response is used to design waveform/receiver-filter pairs for the optimal detection of extended targets in additive noise. In the second, a random target impulse response is used to design waveforms that maximize the mutual information between a target ensemble and the received signal in additive Gaussian noise. The two solutions are contrasted to show the difference between the characteristics of waveforms for extended target detection and information extraction. The optimal target detection solution places as much energy as possible in the largest target scattering mode under the imposed constraints on waveform duration and energy. The optimal information extraction solution distributes the energy among the target scattering modes in order to maximize the mutual information between the target ensemble and the received radar waveform.{$<>$}},

  abstract = {Abstract             Data-driven modeling based on machine learning (ML) is showing enormous potential for weather forecasting. Rapid progress has been made with impressive results for some applications. The uptake of ML methods could be a game changer for the incremental progress in traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) known as the ``quiet revolution'' of weather forecasting. The computational cost of running a forecast with standard NWP systems greatly hinders the improvements that can be made by increasing model resolution and ensemble sizes. An emerging new generation of ML models, developed using high-quality reanalysis datasets like ERA5 for training, allows forecasts that require much lower computational costs and that are highly competitive in terms of accuracy. Here, we compare for the first time ML-generated forecasts with standard NWP-based forecasts in an operational-like context, initialized from the same initial conditions. Focusing on deterministic forecasts, we apply common forecast verification tools to assess to what extent a data-driven forecast produced with one of the recently developed ML models (PanguWeather) matches the quality and attributes of a forecast from one of the leading global NWP systems (the ECMWF IFS). The results are very promising, with comparable accuracy for both global metrics and extreme events, when verified against both the operational IFS analysis and synoptic observations. Overly smooth forecasts, increasing bias with forecast lead time, and poor performance in predicting tropical cyclone intensity are identified as current drawbacks of ML-based forecasts. A new NWP paradigm is emerging relying on inference from ML models and state-of-the-art analysis and reanalysis datasets for forecast initialization and model training.},

  abstract = {Rainfall estimation based on the impact of rain on electromagnetic waves is a novel methodology that has had notable advancements during the last few years. Many studies conducted on this topic in the past considered only the electromagnetic waves with frequencies greater than 10 GHz since the rainfall impact on the electromagnetic wave attenuation is reduced at lower frequencies. Over the last few years, some authors have demonstrated that there can be a non-negligible attenuation even on the signals received on a global system for mobile communications mobile terminal in presence of rain. In this paper, we propose a new classification method based on a probabilistic neural network to obtain an accurate classification between four rainfall intensities (no rain, weak rain, moderate rain, and heavy rain). The innovative rainfall classification method is based on three received signal level (RSL) local features of the 4G/LTE: the instantaneous RSL, the average RSL value, and its variance calculated by using a sliding window. The proposed method exhibits good performance, obtaining an overall correct classification rate of 96.7\%. Almost all papers on this topic present in the literature focus on electromagnetic waves with frequencies greater than 10 GHz, in which the rain impact is more relevant, according to the rain attenuation model. However, only the 4G/LTE signal has such widespread geographic coverage, so the proposed classification method can provide noticeable improvements in the creation of rainfall maps with higher spatial resolution.},

We show via prototypes and experiments that it is possible to achieve communication rates of up to 5 Mbps at a range of 1 m and 1 Mbps at a range of 5 meters. Such performance is an order to three orders of magnitude better than the best known prior WiFi backscatter system [27,25]. BackFi design is energy efficient, as it relies on backscattering alone and needs insignificant power, hence the energy consumed per bit is small.},

In this talk, I would present active and passive RF sensing platforms, wherein active approaches require a transmitter to transmit the signal and measure reflections to perceive the environment and passive relies on ambient transmissions. Furthermore, the platforms I would describe inherently allows for concurrent productive communication for both active and passive sensing. The landscape of concurrent RF sensing and communication is relatively unexplored, allowing students to choose many interesting research problems to choose from and platforms to conduct research.},

We introduce SociTrack, a platform for autonomous social interaction tracking via wireless distance measurements. Deployments require no supporting infrastructure and provide sub-second, decimeter-accurate ranging information over multiple days. The key insight that enables both deployability and fidelity in one system is to decouple node mobility and network management from range measurement, which results in a novel dual-radio architecture. SociTrack leverages an energy-efficient and scalable ranging protocol that is accurate to 14.8 cm (99th percentile) in complex indoor environments and allows our prototype to operate for 12 days on a 2000 mAh battery. Finally, to validate its deployability and efficacy, SociTrack is used by early childhood development researchers to capture caregiver-infant interactions.},

We reviewed the existing studies on fever screening by NCIT to estimate their efficacy under the hypothesis of pandemic influenza. Three Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or dengue fever interventions in airports were excluded because of insufficient information. Six fever screening studies in other gathering areas, mainly hospitals, were included (N= 176 to 72,327 persons; fever prevalence= 1.2\% to 16.9\%). Sensitivity varied from 4.0\% to 89.6\%, specificity from 75.4\% to 99.6\%, positive predictive value (PPV) from 0.9\% to 76.0\% and negative predictive value (NPV) from 86.1\% to 99.7\%. When we fixed fever prevalence at 1\% in all studies to allow comparisons, the derived PPV varied from 3.5\% to 65.4\% and NPV was {$>$}=99\%. The low PPV suggests limited efficacy of NCIT to detect symptomatic passengers at the early stages of a pandemic influenza, when fever prevalence among passengers would be ={$<$}1\%. External factors can also impair the screening strategy: passengers can hide their symptoms or cross borders before symptoms occur. These limits should be considered when setting up border control measures to delay the pandemic progression.},

  abstract = {Frequent blood pressure (BP) assessment is key to the diagnosis and treatment of many severe diseases, such as heart failure, kidney failure, hypertension, and hemodialysis. Current "gold-standard'' BP measurement techniques require the complete blockage of blood flow, which causes discomfort and disruption to normal activity when the assessment is done repetitively and frequently. Unfortunately, patients with hypertension or hemodialysis often have to get their BP measured every 15 minutes for a duration of 4-5 hours or more. The discomfort of wearing a cumbersome and limited mobility device affects their normal activities. In this work, we propose a device called eBP to measure BP from inside the user's ear aiming to minimize the measurement's impact on users' normal activities while maximizing its comfort level. eBP has 3 key components: (1) a light-based pulse sensor attached on an inflatable pipe that goes inside the ear, (2) a digital air pump with a fine controller, and (3) a BP estimation algorithm. In contrast to existing devices, eBP introduces a novel technique that eliminates the need to block the blood flow inside the ear, which alleviates the user's discomfort. We prototyped eBP custom hardware and software and evaluated the system through a comparative study on 35 subjects. The study shows that eBP obtains the average error of 1.8 mmHg and -3.1 mmHg and a standard deviation error of 7.2 mmHg and 7.9 mmHg for systolic (high-pressure value) and diastolic (low-pressure value), respectively. These errors are around the acceptable margins regulated by the FDA's AAMI protocol, which allows mean errors of up to 5 mmHg and a standard deviation of up to 8 mmHg.},

  abstract = {Currently, the logistic industry has introduced 3D reconstruction to monitor the package placement in the warehouse. Previous 3D reconstruction solutions mainly utilize computer vision or sensor-based methods, which are restricted to the line-of-sight or the battery life. Therefore, we propose a passive RFID-based solution, called RF-3DScan, to perform 3D reconstruction on tagged packages, including the package orientation and the package stacking. The basic idea is that a moving antenna can obtain RF-signals from the tags attached on packages with the 1D linear mobile scanning. Through extracting phase differences to build angle profiles for each tag, RF-3DScan derives their relative positions, further determines the package orientation and the coarse-grained package stacking. By simply performing the 2D scanning, RF-3DScan can provide the fine-grained package stacking determination. We implement a prototype system of RF-3DScan and evaluate its performance in real settings. Our experiment results show that RF-3DScan can achieve about 92.5 percent identification accuracy of the bottom face, and an average error about 4.08{$^\circ$} of thethe rotation angle. For the package stacking, 1D scanning can achieve the comparable performance in comparison with 2D scanning.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel, generalizable, and scalable idea that eliminates the need for collecting Radio Frequency (RF) measurements, when training RF sensing systems for human-motion-related activities. Existing learning-based RF sensing systems require collecting massive RF training data, which depends heavily on the particular sensing setup/involved activities. Thus, new data needs to be collected when the setup/activities change, significantly limiting the practical deployment of RF sensing systems. On the other hand, recent years have seen a growing, massive number of online videos involving various human activities/motions. In this paper, we propose to translate such already-available online videos to instant simulated RF data for training any human-motion-based RF sensing system, in any given setup. To validate our proposed framework, we conduct a case study of gym activity classification, where CSI magnitude measurements of three WiFi links are used to classify a person's activity from 10 different physical exercises. We utilize YouTube gym activity videos and translate them to RF by simulating the WiFi signals that would have been measured if the person in the video was performing the activity near the transceivers. We then train a classifier on the simulated data, and extensively test it with real WiFi data of 10 subjects performing the activities in 3 areas. Our system achieves a classification accuracy of 86\% on activity periods, each containing an average of 5.1 exercise repetitions, and 81\% on individual repetitions of the exercises. This demonstrates that our approach can generate reliable RF training data from already-available videos, and can successfully train an RF sensing system without any real RF measurements. The proposed pipeline can also be used beyond training and for analysis and design of RF sensing systems, without the need for massive RF data collection.},

However, this imposes a new paradigm on the architecture design of the integrated SIN. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and mobile edge computing (MEC) are the most promising techniques, conceived to improve communication and computation capability by reconfiguring the wireless propagation environment and offloading. Hence, converging RISs and MEC in SIN is becoming an effort to reap the double benefits of computation and communication. In this article, we propose an RIS-assisted collaborative MEC architecture for SIN and discuss its implementation. Then we present its potential benefits, major challenges, and feasible applications. Subsequently, we study different cases to evaluate the system data rate and latency. Finally, we conclude with a list of open issues in this research area.},

The approach is based on the investigation of the statistical properties of the multipath profiles measured in different rooms over a finely spaced measurement grid. The analysis leads to the formulation of a stochastic tapped-delay-line (STDL) model of the UWB indoor channel. The averaged power delay profile can be well-modeled by a single exponential decay with a statistically distributed decay constant. The small-scale statistics of path energy gains follow Gamma distributions whose parameters m are truncated Gaussian variables with mean values and standard deviations decreasing with delay. The total received energy experiences a lognormal shadowing around the mean energy given by the path-loss power law. We also find that the correlation between multipath components is negligible. Finally, we propose an implementation of the STDL model and give a comparison between the experimental data and the simulation results.},

The measurement method is based on an open-ended coaxial probe technique. Two coaxial probes were constructed and their design was optimized in order to meet two contradictory requirements. On the one hand a large probe aperture is needed for sufficient measurement sensitivity at desired frequency range, on the other hand a small probe aperture is better suited for contacting non planar surfaces and avoiding air gaps. The calibration procedure of the measurement setup is explained and experimental results for planar and curved glass material are presented .},

However, scaling out of zillions of mobile devices, drones and objects in IoT will inevitably lead to the dreaded spectrum crunch problem. To alleviate the scarce radio spectrum problem, in this paper, we envision using visible light communication (VLC) for wireless UAV networks to unlock the capacity and propose FLight, a programmable visible-light-band wireless UAV networking system. Unlike RF communications, two main challenges in FLight are (i) limited network coverage because of significant pass loss, and (ii) intermittent visible light connections due to blockage-rich environments. In this paper, we discuss the key research components and open challenges in implementing FLight. By combining VLC and drone networking, FLight opens the way for a new class of applications that will benefit from ground-air and air-air communication.},

  abstract = {High-speed connectivity is key to enabling a range of novel IoT applications. Millimeter-wave (mmWave) backscatter has emerged as a possible solution to create high-speed, low-power IoT networks. However, state-of-the-art mmWave backscatter systems are costly due to the need for dedicated mmWave reader devices. This paper presents mmComb, a mmWave backscatter system that is built to operate on commodity mmWave WiFi. mmComb is developed with the aim that mmWave backscatter tags can be directly integrated into 802.11ad/ay mmWave WiFi networks. mmComb makes two key contributions. First, We propose a technique to communicate with backscatter tags using existing beamforming protocol frames from mmWave WiFi devices, without any protocol modification. Second, we develop a self-interference suppression solution that intelligently uses receive beamforming to extract weak mmWave backscatter signal even in indoor multipath-rich channels. We implement our solution with a tag prototype and 60 GHz commodity WiFi devices. Our results show that mmComb can achieve a maximum data rate of 55 Mbps just by leveraging 802.11ad/ay control frames while consuming 87.3 {\textmu}W with BER lower than 10-3 up to 5.5 m range.},

Over time, regional or global SM and FT datasets with different spatial resolutions have been developed. In response to the requirements of multiscale product validation and multisource uncertainty tracking, a soil moisture and soil temperature (ST) monitoring network in the Qinghai Lake Basin (QLB-NET) was established in September 2019. The QLB-NET is characterized by densely distributed in situ sites (82 sites) measuring SM and ST at 5-, 10-, and 30-cm depths, with 60 sites in a large-scale network covering an area of 36\,km {\texttimes} 40\,km and 22 sites evenly distributed across two small-scale 1\,km {\texttimes} 1\,km networks. Quantitative analyses of the in situ measurements show that the QLB-NET can provide stable and reliable ground truth for SM and FT over coarse grid scales, e.g., 36\,km {\texttimes} 36\,km, 25\,km {\texttimes} 25\,km, and 0.25{$^\circ$} {\texttimes} 0.25{$^\circ$}. When statistics are correspondingly performed over 50 out of 54, 25 out of 29, and 25 out of 28 sites, the results are described as follows: 1) the standard deviation of the mean SM varies between 0.0127 and 0.0196 m               3               m               -3               , with the corresponding difference between the upper and lower quartiles being less than 0.02 m               3               m               -3               ; 2) the ground freeze--thaw state can be correctly identified with high probabilities ranging from 85.3\% to 100\% on two freeze--thaw transitional dates. The QLB-NET observed datasets are distributed online and will be continuously updated through cooperation with the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center (               http://data.tpdc.ac.cn               ), facilitating product validation and uncertainty tracking, spatiotemporal analysis of SM change and FT transition, optimization of the SM and FT retrieving algorithms and scaling methods, and development of the mountainous microwave radiative transfer model.},

  abstract = {We consider an edge-computing setting where machine learning-based algorithms are used for real-time classification of inputs acquired by devices, e.g., cameras. Computational resources on the devices are constrained, and therefore only capable of running machine learning models of limited accuracy. A subset of inputs can be offloaded to the edge for processing by a more accurate but resource-intensive machine learning model. Both models process inputs with low-latency, but offloading incurs network delays. To manage these delays and meet application deadlines, a token bucket constrains transmissions from the device. We introduce a Markov Decision Process-based framework to make offload decisions under such constraints. Decisions are based on the local model's confidence and the token bucket state, with the goal of minimizing a specified error measure for the application. We extend the approach to configurations involving multiple devices connected to the same access switch to realize the benefits of a shared token bucket. We evaluate and analyze the policies derived using our framework on the standard ImageNet image classification benchmark.},

A rise in drone usage introduces privacy and security concerns about flying boundaries, what data drones collect in public and private spaces, and how that data is stored and disseminated. However, commercial and personal drone regulations focusing on privacy and security have been fairly minimal in the USA. To inform privacy and security guidelines for drone design and regulation, we need to understand users' perceptions about drones, privacy and security. In this paper, we describe a laboratory study with 20 participants who interacted with a real or model drone to elicit user perceptions of privacy and security issues around drones. We present our results, discuss the implications of our work and make recommendations to improve drone design and regulations that enhance individual privacy and security.},

For multivariate distributions, we considered the case of independent marginals and the dependence structure between the marginal distributions described by Gaussian copula. The presented solution may be particularly useful for high dimensional data, like those analyzed in the systems biology field. To illustrate such an application, we exploit differential entropy to define the robustness of biochemical kinetic models.},

Meanwhile, humans' understanding of the world is always limited, and knowledge discovery takes advantage of machine learning to extract new knowledge from observations. Knowledge discovery can not only assist researchers to better grasp the nature of physics, but it can also support them in conducting knowledge embedding research. A closed loop of knowledge generation and usage are formed by combining knowledge embedding with knowledge discovery, which can improve the robustness and accuracy of models and uncover previously unknown scientific principles.

Nevertheless, the intrinsic difference between communication and sensing functionalities has imposed challenges in fully realizing the promise of the technology. In this paper, we propose a Pareto optimization framework for a multi-antenna DFRC system, where a single transmitter with multiple antennas communicates with multiple users and detects radar targets simultaneously. To begin with, we define an achievable performance region that is built upon the difference between peak and sidelobe (DPSL) of the radar spatial beampattern and the signal-to-interference-plusnoise ratio (SINR) of each communication user, which is proved to be compact and normal. Then, we formulate a fairness-profile optimization problem with a lowest acceptable performance level of dual functionalities and a pre-defined direction to attain the Pareto boundary of the achievable performance region. Also, we provide a bisection search algorithm to solve the Pareto optimization problem with polynomial complexity, and prove its optimality can be achieved by single-stream transmission. As a further step, we extend the discussion to the DFRC beamforming design given hardware impairments. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed design and the impact brought by the impairments by numerical simulations.},

  abstract = {Accurate tracking of the hands and fingers allows users to employ natural gestures in various interactive applications. Hand tracking also supports health applications, such as monitoring face-touching, a common vector for infectious disease. However, for both types of applications, the utility of hand tracking is often limited by the impracticality of bulky tethered systems (e.g., instrumented gloves) or inherent limitations (e.g., Line of Sight or privacy concerns with vision-based systems). These limitations have severely restricted the adoption of hand tracking in real-world applications. We present MagX, a fully untethered on-body hand tracking system utilizing passive magnets and a novel magnetic sensing platform. Since passive magnets require no maintenance, they can be worn on the hands indefinitely, and only the sensor board needs recharging, akin to a smartwatch.},

This work introduces a novel approach called physics-informed neural network with sparse regression to discover governing partial differential equations from scarce and noisy data for nonlinear spatiotemporal systems. In particular, this discovery approach seamlessly integrates the strengths of deep neural networks for rich representation learning, physics embedding, automatic differentiation and sparse regression to approximate the solution of system variables, compute essential derivatives, as well as identify the key derivative terms and parameters that form the structure and explicit expression of the equations. The efficacy and robustness of this method are demonstrated, both numerically and experimentally, on discovering a variety of partial differential equation systems with different levels of data scarcity and noise accounting for different initial/boundary conditions. The resulting computational framework shows the potential for closed-form model discovery in practical applications where large and accurate datasets are intractable to capture.},

To achieve this, a critical challenge is to identify the person who carries a device in the video with the mobile device's network ID, e.g., MAC address. To address this issue, we propose RFCam, a system for human identification with a fusion of Wi-Fi and camera data. RFCam uses a multi-antenna Wi-Fi radio to collect CSI of Wi-Fi packets sent by mobile devices, and a camera to monitor users in the area. With low sampling rate CSI data, RFCam derives heterogeneous embedding features on location, motion, and user activity for each device over time, and fuses them with visual user features generated from video analytics to find the best matches. To mitigate the impacts of multi-user environments on wireless sensing, we develop video-assisted learning models for different features and quantify their uncertainties, and incorporate them with video analytics to rank moments and features for robust and efficient fusion. RFCam is implemented and tested in indoor environments for over 800 minutes with 25 volunteers, and extensive evaluation results demonstrate that RFCam achieves real-time identification average accuracy of 97.01\% in all experiments with up to ten users, significantly outperforming existing solutions.

Previous studies have mostly focused on improving differentiable grasping metrics with the assumption of precisely known object geometry. However, shape uncertainty is ubiquitous due to noisy and partial shape observations, which introduce challenges in grasp planning. We propose, SpringGrasp planner, a planner that considers uncertain observations of the object surface for synthesizing compliant dexterous grasps. A compliant dexterous grasp could minimize the effect of unexpected contact with the object, leading to more stable grasp with shape-uncertain objects. We introduce an analytical and differentiable metric, SpringGrasp metric, that evaluates the dynamic behavior of the entire compliant grasping process. Planning with SpringGrasp planner, our method achieves a grasp success rate of 89\% from two viewpoints and 84\% from a single viewpoints in experiment with a real robot on 14 common objects. Compared with a forceclosure based planner, our method achieves at least 18\% higher grasp success rate.},

Instead of locating devices, DfP technology directly locates human bodies. This promising technology upgrades and even redefines many services, such as intruder alarm, fire rescue, fall detection, baby monitoring, etc. Using Wi-Fi based fingerprints, DfP approaches can achieve a nearly perfect accuracy with a resolution less than one meter. However, Wi-Fi localization profiles may easily drift with a minor environment change, resulting in an inconsistency between fingerprints and new profiles. This inconsistency issue could lead to large errors, and may quickly ruin the whole system. To address this issue, we propose a approach named AutoFi to automatically calibrate the localization profiles in an unsupervised manner. AutoFi embraces a new technique that online estimates and cancels profile contaminants introduced by environment changes. It applies an autoencoder to preserve critical features of fingerprints, and reproduces them later in new localization profiles. Experiment results demonstrate that AutoFi indeed rescues the Wi-Fi fingerprints from variations in the surrounding. The localization accuracy is improved from 18.8\% (before auto-calibration) to 84.9\% (after auto-calibration).},

However, the small form-factor, low-profile hardware interfaces and computational resources limit their capabilities in security checking. Many wristband devices have recently witnessed alarming vulnerabilities, e.g., personal data leakage and payment fraud, due to the lack of authentication and access control. To fill this gap, we propose a secure text pin input system, namely Taprint, which extends a virtual number pad on the back of a user's hand. Taprint builds on the key observation that the hand "landmarks'', especially finger knuckles, bear unique vibration characteristics when being tapped by the user herself. It thus uses the tapping vibrometry as biometrics to authenticate the user, while distinguishing the tapping locations. Taprint reuses the inertial measurement unit in the wristband, "overclocks'' its sampling rate to extrapolate fine-grained features, and further refines the features to enhance the uniqueness and reliability. Extensive experiments on 128 users demonstrate that Taprint achieves a high accuracy (96\%) of keystrokes recognition. It can authenticate users, even through a single-tap, at extremely low error rate (2.4\%), and under various practical usage disturbances.},

  abstract = {Temperature sensor is one of the most widespread technologies in the IoT era. Wireless temperature monitoring systems are convenient to deploy and can drive mass applications in the fields of smart home, transportation and logistics. Currently, wireless temperature monitoring products are based on microelectronic and semiconductor components, which are not cost-effective (e.g., a few dollars) and more importantly, generate electronic wastes. In this work, we present ThermoWave, a new paradigm of wireless temperature monitoring that is ecological, battery-less, and ultra-low cost. Specifically, ThermoWave is on the basis of the thermal scattering effect on millimeter-wave (mmWave) signals. Specifically, cholesteryl materials align their molecular patterns at different environmental temperatures, and this temperature-induced pattern change will be modulated and sensed by the scattered mmWave signals. There are three functional modules in the ThermoWave system. The ThermoTag is a cholesteryl material inked film or paper tag that can be conveniently attached to the object of interest to monitor temperature changes. Each ThermoTag costs less than 0.01 dollars. The temperature modulated mmWave scattering will be received by a mmWave-radar based ThermoScanner and demodulated by a software-based temperature decoder ThermoSense, which includes a model-based method (i.e., ThermoDot) for point temperature estimation and a data-driven method (i.e., ThermoNet) for thermal imaging. We prototype and evaluate the ThermoWave system performance in both controlled and real-world setups. Experimental results show that the ThermoWave achieves the precision of {\textpm}1.0{$^\circ$}F in the range of 30{$^\circ$}F to 120{$^\circ$}F in a controlled setup. We also investigate the performance in real-world applications, and the ThermoWave can reach the {\textpm}3.0{$^\circ$}F precision in the temperature estimation. We also test and discuss sustainability, durability, robustness, and cost-effectiveness of the ThermoWave in both design and experiments.},

Here, we present the first underwater acoustic positioning system for smart devices. Unlike conventional systems that use floating buoys as anchors at known locations, we design a system where a dive leader can compute the relative positions of all other divers, without any external infrastructure. Our intuition is that in a well-connected network of devices, if we compute the pairwise distances, we can determine the shape of the network topology. By incorporating orientation information about a single diver who is in the visual range of the leader device, we can then estimate the positions of all the remaining divers, even if they are not within sight. We address various practical problems including detecting erroneous distance estimates, addressing rotational and flipping ambiguities as well as designing a distributed timestamp protocol that scales linearly with the number of devices. Our evaluations show that our distributed system running on underwater deployments of 4-5 commodity smart devices can perform pairwise ranging and localization with median errors of 0.5-0.9 m and 0.9-1.6 m.},

Six-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) pose tracking is the core of drone flight control, but existing solutions cannot be directly applied to indoor scenarios due to insufficient accuracy, low robustness to adverse texture and light conditions, and signal obstruction in indoor scenarios. To overcome the above limitations, we propose Wi-Drone, a Wi-Fi standalone 6-DoF tracking system for indoor drone flight control. Wi-Drone takes full advantage of both exteroceptive and proprioceptive measurements of Wi-Fi to estimate the drone's absolute pose and relative motion, and fuse them in a tight-coupling manner to achieve their complementary benefits. We implement Wi-Drone and integrate it into a flight control system. The evaluation results show that Wi-Drone achieves a real-time performance with the average location accuracy of 26.1 cm and the rotation accuracy of 3.8{\textopenbullet}, which demonstrates its competency of flight control, compared to visual-inertial-based flight control. Such results also outperform existing Wi-Fi-based tracking solutions in terms of both dimensionality and accuracy.},

  abstract = {To support ubiquitous computing for various applications (such as smart health, smart homes, and smart cities), the communication system requires to be ubiquitously available, ultra-low-power, high throughput, and low-latency. A passive communication system such as backscatter is desirable. However, existing backscatter systems cannot achieve all of the above requirements. In this paper, we present the first LTE backscatter (LScatter) system that leverages the continuous LTE ambient traffic for ubiquitous, high throughput and low latency backscatter communication. Our design is motivated by our observation that LTE ambient traffic is continuous (v.s. bursty and intermittent WiFi/LoRa traffic), which makes LTE ambient traffic a perfect signal source of a backscatter system. Our design addresses practical issues such as time synchronization, phase modulation, as well as phase offset elimination. We extensively evaluated our design using a testbed of backscatter hardware and USRPs in multiple real-world scenarios. Results show that our LScatter's performance is consistently orders of magnitude better than WiFi backscatter in all the above scenarios. For example, LScatter's throughput is 13.63Mbps, which is 368 times higher than the latest ambient WiFi backscatter system [54]. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our system using two real-world applications.},

As this promising technology enables a long-range communication for sensors with low power in a distributed area, it is desirable to support wireless powered communication networks (WPCNs) that experience doubly near-far problem. In a backscatter radio based WPCN, users harvest energy from both the signal broadcast by the hybrid access point and the carrier signal transmitted by the carrier emitter in the downlink and transmit their own information in a passive way via the reflection of the carrier signal using frequency-shift keying modulation in the uplink. We characterize the energy-free condition and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) outage zone in a backscatter radio based WPCN. Numerical results demonstrate that the backscatter radio based WPCN achieves an increased long-range coverage and a diminished SNR outage zone compared to the active radio based WPCNs.},

We present RF-Echo, a new low-power RF localization solution that achieves decimeter accuracy in long range indoor non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. RF-Echo introduces a custom-designed active RF reflector ASIC (application specific integrated circuit) fabricated in a 180nm CMOS process which echoes a frequency-shifted orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal originally generated from an anchor. The proposed technique is based on time-of-flight (ToF) estimation in the frequency domain that effectively eliminates inter-carrier and inter-symbol interference in multipath-rich indoor NLOS channels. RF-Echo uses a relatively narrow bandwidth of \${\textbackslash}leq\$80 MHz which does not require an expensive very high sampling rate analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Unlike ultra-wideband (UWB) systems, the active reflection scheme is designed to operate at a relatively low carrier frequency that can penetrate building walls and other blocking objects for challenging NLOS scenarios. Since the bandwidth at lower frequencies (2.4 GHz and sub-1 GHz) is severely limited, we propose novel signal processing algorithms as well as machine learning techniques to significantly enhance the localization resolution given the bandwidth constraint of the proposed system. The newly fabricated tag IC consumes 62.8 mW active power. The software defined radio (SDR) based anchor prototype is rapidly deployable without the need for accurate synchronization among anchors and tags. Field trials conducted in a university building confirm up to 85 m operation with decimeter accuracy for robust 2D localization.},

The available technologies are divided into four categories: wearables, surfaces with embedded sensors, vision- and environmental-based solutions, and smart containers. A detailed performance evaluation was carried out considering detection accuracy, usability and availability. It was observed that the most promising results came from studies that used data fusion from multiple technologies, compared to using an individual technology.

In this equation, {$\varepsilon$}* is the complex dielectric constant, {$\varepsilon$}0 and {$\varepsilon\infty$} are the ``static'' and ``infinite frequency'' dielectric constants, {$\omega$}=2{$\pi$} times the frequency, and {$\tau$}0 is a generalized relaxation time. The parameter {$\alpha$} can assume values between 0 and 1, the former value giving the result of Debye for polar dielectrics. The expression (1) requires that the locus of the dielectric constant in the complex plane be a circular arc with end points on the axis of reals and center below this axis.             If a distribution of relaxation times is assumed to account for Eq. (1), it is possible to calculate the necessary distribution function by the method of Fuoss and Kirkwood. It is, however, difficult to understand the physical significance of this formal result.             If a dielectric satisfying Eq. (1) is represented by a three-element electrical circuit, the mechanism responsible for the dispersion is equivalent to a complex impedance with a phase angle which is independent of the frequency. On this basis, the mechanism of interaction has the striking property that energy is conserved or ``stored'' in addition to being dissipated and that the ratio of the average energy stored to the energy dissipated per cycle is independent of the frequency.},

Supporting the network with additional BSs increases the total capacity of the network. However, this process may reduce the energy efficiency of the network. The proposed algorithm studies the energy efficiency aspect of the micro BS deployment problem. The deployment problem can be divided into two subproblems: choosing candidate locations for micro BSs and selecting the optimum set among these candidates. Inhomogeneous distribution of the candidate locations is misleading for different user sets. Selecting the optimum micro BSs among the candidate locations is a combinatorial problem. To provide an approximate solution to this problem, we propose a greedy algorithm. Our simulation results demonstrate that by optimizing the BS location and the number of BSs to be deployed, the energy efficiency of the system with only macro BSs can be improved up to 1.4--1.65 times for a range of realistic micro BS transmit power levels.},

The fundamentals of the wireless sensing technology are summarized in the first part of the work, and the benefits of adopting RFID sensors for replacing standard sensor-equipped Wi-Fi nodes are discussed. Emphasis is put on the absence of batteries and the lower cost of RFID sensors with respect to other sensor solutions available on the market. RFID sensors are critically compared by separating them into chipped and chipless configurations. Both categories are further analyzed with reference to their working mechanism (electronic, electromagnetic, and acoustic). RFID sensing through chip-equipped tags is now a mature technological solution, which is continuously increasing its presence on the market and in several applicative scenarios. On the other hand, chipless RFID sensing represents a relatively new concept, which could become a disruptive solution in the market, but further research in this field is necessary for customizing its employment in specific scenarios. The benefits and limitations of several tag configurations are shown and discussed. A summary of the most suitable applicative scenarios for RFID sensors are finally illustrated. Finally, a look at some sensing solutions available on the market are described and compared.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Between 2014 and 2018, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration conducted the NOAA Satellite Observing System Architecture (NSOSA) study to plan for the next generation of operational environmental satellites. The study generated some important questions that could be addressed by observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs). This paper describes a series of OSSEs in which benefits to numerical weather prediction from existing observing systems are combined with enhancements from potential future capabilities. Assessments include the relative value of the quantity of different types of thermodynamic soundings for global numerical weather applications. We compare the relative impact of several sounding configuration scenarios for infrared (IR), microwave (MW), and radio occultation (RO) observing capabilities. The main results are 1) increasing the revisit rate for satellite radiance soundings produces the largest benefits but at a significant cost by requiring an increase in the number of polar-orbiting satellites from 2 to 12; 2) a large positive impact is found when the number of RO soundings per day is increased well beyond current values and other observations are held at current levels of performance; 3) RO can be used as a mitigation strategy for lower MW/IR sounding revisit rates, particularly in the tropics; and 4) smaller benefits result from increasing the horizontal resolution along the track of the satellites of MW/IR satellite radiances. Furthermore, disaggregating IR and MW instruments into six evenly distributed sun-synchronous orbits is slightly more beneficial than when the same instruments are combined and collocated on three separate orbits.},

RFID sensor tags featuring contactless sensing, wireless information transfer, wireless powered, light weight, non-line-of-sight transmission, flexible and pasteable are a critical enabling technology for future Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, such as manufacturing, logistics, healthcare, agriculture and food. They have attracted numerous research efforts due to their innovative potential in the various application fields.

  abstract = {Visible light communication (VLC) is gaining a significant amount of interest as a new paradigm to meet rapidly increasing demands on wireless capacity required by a digitalized world. VLC is considered as a secure wireless communication scheme because VLC signals can be easily constrained within physical boundaries. In this paper, for the first time, we show that VLC is not as secure as people thought: VLC can be sniffed through walls! The key principle behind this is that in VLC transmissions, a VLC transmitter not only emits visible light signals but also leaks out 'side channel RF signals'. The leaked RF signals can be sniffed by a receiver to decode the VLC transmissions even the receiver is blocked (e.g., by walls) from the VLC transmitter. In this work, we establish a theoretical model to quantify the amplitude of the leaked RF signal and verify the model with comprehensive experiments. We design and implement a VLC sniffing system including receiver coil design, signal processing and frame decoding, spanning across hardware and software. Field studies show that with a cheap receiver design, our system can simultaneously sniff transmissions from multiple VLC transmitters 6.4 meters away with a 14 cm concrete wall in between, where the distance exceeds the communication range of most state-of-the-art VLC systems. By simply twining a wired earphone on the arm, we can sniff the VLC transmission 1.9 meters away.},

  abstract = {Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) presents a promising avenue for fulfilling the essential perception and localization tasks in autonomous driving systems using cost-effective visual sensors. Nevertheless, existing visual SLAM frameworks often suffer from substantial cumulative errors and performance degradation in complicated driving scenarios. In this paper, we propose VILAM, a novel framework that leverages intelligent roadside infrastructures to realize high-precision and globally consistent localization and mapping on autonomous vehicles. The key idea of VILAM is to utilize the precise scene measurement from the infrastructure as global references to correct errors in the local map constructed by the vehicle. To overcome the unique deformation in the 3D local map to align it with the infrastructure measurement, VILAM proposes a novel elastic point cloud registration method that enables independent optimization of different parts of the local map. Moreover, VILAM adopts a lightweight factor graph construction and optimization to first correct the vehicle trajectory, and thus reconstruct the consistent global map efficiently. We implement the VILAM end-to-end on a real-world smart lamppost testbed in multiple road scenarios. Extensive experiment results show that VILAM can achieve decimeter-level localization and mapping accuracy with consumer-level onboard cameras and is robust under diverse road scenarios. A video demo of VILAM on our real-world testbed is available at https://youtu.be/lTlqDNipDVE.},

The RFID+ delivers a level of spatial precision comparable to that of HF NFC systems, effectively mitigating issues of miss-reading and cross-reading. Our primary contributions reside in the development of a specialized multi-turn, capacitor-segmented coil antenna and an innovative fast inventory algorithm. The RFID+ seamlessly integrates traditional radiative coupling with the innovative magnetic coupling in UHF RFID systems, bolstering their overall performance and efficiency. Real-world pilot studies in warehouses and logistics settings reveal that RFID+ significantly diminishes the miss-reading rate from 22.9\% down to a remarkable 1.06\%, while entirely eliminating cross-reading challenges. Moreover, our RFID+ variant demonstrates better resilience against materials traditionally challenging for UHF RFID, such as water bottles and containers.

The development of the smart ocean is expected to support a variety of marine applications and services such as resource exploration, marine disaster rescuing, and environment monitoring. However, the complex and dynamic marine environments and the limited network resources raise new challenges in marine communication and computing, especially for these computing-intensive and delay-sensitive tasks. Recently, the space--air--ground--sea integrated networks have been envisioned as a promising network framework to enhance the communication and computing performance. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey on the integrated sensing, communication, and computing networks (ISCCNs) for smart oceans based on the collaboration of space--air--ground--sea networks from four domains (i.e., space layer, aerial layer, sea surface layer, and underwater layer), and five aspects (i.e., sensing-related, communication-related, computation-related, security-related, and application-related). Specifically, we provide the key technologies for the ISCCNs in smart oceans, and introduce the state-of-the-art marine sensing, communication, and computing paradigms. The emerging challenges with the potential solutions of the ISCCNs for smart oceans are illustrated to enable the intelligent services. Moreover, the new applications for the ISCCNs in smart oceans are discussed, and potential research directions in smart oceans are provided for future works.},

The collected data are then compressed and transmitted to a base station located at up to 1.8 kilometers (approximately 1.1 miles) away. The entire IoTree system is powered by wind energy and controlled by an adaptive computing technique called block-based intermittent computing, ensuring the forward progress and data consistency under intermittent power and allowing the firmware to execute with the most optimal memory and energy usage. We prototype IoTree that opportunistically performs sensing, data compression, and long-range communication tasks without batteries. During in-lab experiments, IoTree also obtains the accuracy of 91.08\% and 90.51\% in measuring 10 levels of nutrients, {$N$} {$H$}3 and {$K$}2{$O$}, respectively. While tested with Burkwood Viburnum and White Bird trees in the indoor environment, IoTree data strongly correlated with multiple watering and fertilizing events. We also deployed IoTree on a grapevine farm for 30 days, and the system is able to provide sufficient measurements every day.},

Instead of the traditional ground soil-moisture measurement, the leaf sensing is a new technology, which is used for the detection of plants needing water. In this paper, a novel, low-cost, and low-power system for leaf sensing using a new plant backscatter sensor node/tag is presented. The latter, can result in the prevention of water waste (water-use efficiency), when is connected to an irrigation system. Specifically, the sensor measures the temperature differential between the leaf and the air, which is directly related to the plant water stress. Next, the tag collects the information from the leaf sensor through an analog-to-digital converter, and then, communicates remotely with a low-cost software-defined radio reader using monostatic backscatter architecture. The tag consists of the sensor board, a microcontroller, an external timer, and an RF front-end for communication. The timer produces a subcarrier frequency for simultaneous access of multiple tags. The proposed work could be scaled and be a part of a large backscatter wireless sensor network. The communication protocol exploits the low-complexity Morse code modulation on a 868 MHz carrier signal. The presented novel proof-of-consent prototype is batteryless and was powered by a flexible solar panel consuming power around 20 {$\mu$}W. The performance was validated in an indoors environment where wireless communication was successfully achieved up to 2 m distance.},

  abstract = {Vision-based drone-view object detection suffers from severe performance degradation under adverse conditions (e.g., foggy weather, poor illumination). To remedy this, leveraging complementary mmWave radar has become a trend. However, existing fusion approaches seldom apply to drones due to i) the aggravated sparsity and noise of point clouds from low-cost commodity radars, and ii) explosive sensing data and intensive computations leading to high latency. To address these issues, we design Geryon, an edge assisted object detection system on drones, which utilizes a suit of approaches to fully exploit the complementary advantages of camera and mmWave radar on three levels: (i) a novel multi-frame compositing approach utilizes camera to assist radar to address the aggravated sparsity and noise of radar point clouds; (ii) a saliency area extraction and encoding approach utilizes radar to assist camera to reduce the bandwidth consumption and offloading latency; (iii) a parallel transmission and inference approach with a lightweight box enhancement scheme further reduces the offloading latency while ensuring the edge-side accuracy-latency trade-off by the parallelism and better camera-radar fusion. We implement and evaluate Geryon with four datasets we collect under foggy/rainy/snowy weather and poor illumination conditions, demonstrating its great advantages over other state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both accuracy and latency.

  abstract = {This paper shows the feasibility of identifying liquids by shining ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless signals through them. The core opportunity arises from the fact that wireless signals experience distinct slow-down and attenuation when passing through a liquid, manifesting in the phase, strength, and propagation delay of the outgoing signal. While this intuition is simple, building a robust system entails numerous challenges, including (1) pico-second scale time of flight estimation, (2) coping with integer ambiguity due to phase wraps, (3) pollution from hardware noise and multipath, and (4) compensating for the liquid-container's impact on the measurements. We address these challenges through multiple stages of signal processing without relying on any feature extraction or machine learning. Instead, we model the behavior of radio signals inside liquids (using principles of physics), and estimate the liquid's permittivity, which in turn identifies the liquid. Experiments across 33 different liquids (spread over the whole permittivity spectrum) show median permittivity error of 9\%. This implies that coke can be discriminated from diet coke or pepsi, whole milk from 2\% milk, and distilled water from saline water. Our end system, LiquID, is cheap, non-invasive, and amenable to real-world applications.},

However, limited by the existing electric circuit architecture, either the AC or DC bridges have the shortcoming that the rates or precisions degenerate markedly in the multi-channel scanning mode. To overcome this disadvantage, a round-robin structural low-cost ratiometric resistance thermometer readout based on several commercial 32-bit sigma-delta analogue-to-digital converters ({$\Sigma$}-{$\Delta$} ADCs) was presented in this article. The experimental results show that the precision of this readout corresponds to 0.1 mK at 1 Hz when sampling four channel resistors simultaneously, while the precision and rate are not degenerating with the channel number increasing. In addition, the uncertainty of the readout is investigated in this article. It shows that the presented readout can achieve an uncertainty as low as 2.1 mK at 1 Hz (K = 2).},

  abstract = {A comparative investigation of electric conductivity, complex permittivity, and microwave absorbing properties of KD-1 and Nicalon-202 fibers in the form of fabrics within the range of 8.2--12.4~GHz (X band) has been carried out. The electric conductivity value of KD-1 filaments is two orders larger than Nicalon-202. Both the values of real part ({$\varepsilon\prime$}) and imaginary part ({$\varepsilon{''}$}) of KD-1 fabrics are larger than their counterparts of Nicalon-202 especially the imaginary part, which is in agreement with larger DC conductivity ({$\sigma$}d). The surface morphology and chemical component were characterized by SEM, EDS, Raman spectroscopy and XRD, which shows that both the KD-1 and Nicalon-202 SiC fibers are rich in carbon, while there is rich carbon layer on the surface of the former and the degree of order in the free carbon phase is higher compared with the latter. In addition, the amount of amorphous Si--C--O phase of KD-1 fibers is higher while the SiC crystal is smaller than Nicalon-202. The free carbon on the surface of KD-1 fibers can establish electric conductivity network. The larger {$\varepsilon{''}$} and {$\varepsilon\prime$} of KD-1 fabrics are believed to be mainly caused by conductive network established by rich carbon outer layer and relaxation polarization enhanced by more Si--C--O phase. The reflection loss of KD-1 and Nicalon-202 fabrics is -3.5 to 0.7 and -5.1 to -4.3~dB, calculated according to tested complex permittivity.},

  abstract = {Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs) are an emerging wireless platform which can support battery-powered devices lasting 10-years while communicating at low data-rates to gateways several kilometers away. Not all such devices will experience the promised 10 year battery life despite the high density of LPWAN gateways expected in cities. Transmission from devices located deep within buildings or in remote neighborhoods will suffer severe attenuation forcing the use of slow data-rates to reach even the closest gateway, thus resulting in battery drain. This paper presents Charm, a system that enhances both the battery life of client devices and the coverage of LPWANs in large urban deployments. Charm allows multiple LoRaWAN gateways to pool their received signals in the cloud, coherently combining them to detect weak signals that are not decodable at any individual gateway. Through a novel hardware and software design at the gateway, Charm carefully detects which chunks of the received signal need to be sent to the cloud, thereby saving uplink bandwidth. We present a scalable solution to decoding weak transmissions at city-scale by identifying the set of gateways whose signals need to be coherently combined over time. In evaluations over a test network and from simulations using traces from a large LoRaWAN deployment in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Charm demonstrates a gain of up to 3{\texttimes} in range and 4{\texttimes} in client battery-life.},

  abstract = {Finding the sparsest solution to underdetermined systems of linear equations y = {$\Phi$}x is NP-hard in general. We show here that for systems with ``typical''/``random'' {$\Phi$}, a good approximation to the sparsest solution is obtained by applying a fixed number of standard operations from linear algebra. Our proposal, Stagewise Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (StOMP), successively transforms the signal into a negligible residual. Starting with initial residual r0 = y, at the s -th stage it forms the ``matched filter'' {$\Phi$}Trs-1, identifies all coordinates with amplitudes exceeding a specially chosen threshold, solves a least-squares problem using the selected coordinates, and subtracts the least-squares fit, producing a new residual. After a fixed number of stages (e.g., 10), it stops. In contrast to Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP), many coefficients can enter the model at each stage in StOMP while only one enters per stage in OMP; and StOMP takes a fixed number of stages (e.g., 10), while OMP can take many (e.g., n). We give both theoretical and empirical support for the large-system effectiveness of StOMP. We give numerical examples showing that StOMP rapidly and reliably finds sparse solutions in compressed sensing, decoding of error-correcting codes, and overcomplete representation.},

Further, we use the proposed method to analyze a public safety scenario where it is essential to determine the position of at-risk individuals within buildings, emphasizing improving the Z-axis position estimate. Our analysis uses the Geometrical Theory of Diffraction (GTD) to provide important signal propagation insights and develop a new NLOS path model. Next, we use Fisher information to derive necessary and sufficient conditions for 3D positioning using our proposed positioning technique and finally to lower bound the possible 3D and z-axis positioning performance. On applying this positioning technique in a public safety scenario, we show that it is possible to greatly improve both 3D and Z-axis positioning performance by directly estimating NLOS path lengths.},

  abstract = {In the last decade, the bandwidth expansion and MIMO spatial multiplexing have promised to increase data throughput by orders of magnitude. However, we are yet to enjoy such improvement in real-world environments, as they lack rich scattering and preclude effective MIMO spatial multiplexing. In this paper, we present ScatterMIMO, which uses smart surface to increase the scattering in the environment, to provide MIMO spatial multiplexing gain. Specifically, smart surface pairs up with a wireless transmitter device say an active AP and re-radiates the same amount of power as any active access point (AP), thereby creating virtual passive APs. ScatterMIMO avoids the synchronization, interference, and power requirements of conventional distributed MIMO systems by leveraging virtual passive APs, allowing its smart surface to provide spatial multiplexing gain, which can be deployed at a very low cost. We show that with optimal placement, these virtual APs can provide signals to their clients with power comparable to real active APs, and can increase the coverage of an AP. Furthermore, we design algorithms to optimize ScatterMIMO's smart surface for each client with minimal measurement overhead and to overcome random per-packet phase offsets during the measurement. Our evaluations show that with commercial off-the-shelf MIMO WiFi (11ac) AP and unmodified clients, ScatterMIMO provides a median throughput improvement of 2 X over the active AP alone.},

  author = {Du, Caihui and Yu, Jihong and Zhang, Rongrong},
  abstract = {The existing ambient backscatter systems suffer from either more spectrum utilization or low throughput. we propose Orthcatter, the first in-band OFDM backscatter system that provides a higher throughput while consuming fewer spectrum resources. Our key innovation is the designed over-theair code division technique that enables the cancellation of the co-channel interferences, solving the core challenge of the in-band backscatter communication. Unlike the common code-division systems that generate orthogonal codewords locally, we construct the quasi-orthogonal backscatter codewords by swapping the subcarriers of each excitation OFDM symbol and concrete this design passively with a double side-band symbol construction method. Armed with these quasi-orthogonal codewords, we design a two-step interference cancellation scheme, significantly improving reliability. We prototype and test Orthcatter. The results show that Orthcatter can achieve throughput of 248kbps and a BER of 10-4 under OFDM WiFi exciter, improving by over 4.6{\texttimes} and 300{\texttimes} compared with the state-of-the-art in-band backscatter system. Our throughput and BER can even be 11kbps higher and 59{\texttimes} better than the prior side-band backscatter systems, and the exciter-to-tag communication range is 3{\texttimes} of prior OFDM backscatter systems.},

We give a general impossibility result showing that a formalization of Dalenius' goal along the lines of semantic security cannot be achieved. Contrary to intuition, a variant of the result threatens the privacy even of someone not in the database. This state of affairs suggests a new measure, differential privacy, which, intuitively, captures the increased risk to one's privacy incurred by participating in a database. The techniques developed in a sequence of papers [8, 13, 3], culminating in those described in [12], can achieve any desired level of privacy under this measure. In many cases, extremely accurate information about the database can be provided while simultaneously ensuring very high levels of privacy},

However, the obscurity of decisions by DRL policies renders it hard to ascertain that learning-augmented systems are safe to deploy, posing a significant obstacle to their real-world adoption. We observe that specific characteristics of recent applications of DRL to systems contexts give rise to an exciting opportunity: applying formal verification to establish that a given system provably satisfies designer/user-specified requirements, or to expose concrete counter-examples. We present whiRL, a platform for verifying DRL policies for systems, which combines recent advances in the verification of deep neural networks with scalable model checking techniques. To exemplify its usefulness, we employ whiRL to verify natural equirements from recently introduced learning-augmented systems for three real-world environments: Internet congestion control, adaptive video streaming, and job scheduling in compute clusters. Our evaluation shows that whiRL is capable of guaranteeing that natural requirements from these systems are satisfied, and of exposing specific scenarios in which other basic requirements are not.},

Those who sought privacy and security information before purchase, reported that it was difficult or impossible to find. We asked interviewees to rank factors they would consider when purchasing IoT devices; after features and price, privacy and security were ranked among the most important. Finally, we showed interviewees our prototype privacy and security label. Almost all found it to be accessible and useful, encouraging them to incorporate privacy and security in their IoT purchase decisions.},

Numerical results show that the energy harvesting and coverage probabilities can be maximized at almost the same altitude of the ABSs with respect to the TBSs height for low TBSs densities. However, as the density of the backhaul nodes and the energy harvesting sub-timeslot increases, energy harvesting probability improves while coverage probability monotonically decreases by increasing the ABSs height.},

We focus on the problem of resource-constrained UAV trajectory design with: 1) optimal channel parameters learning and 2) optimal data throughput as key objectives, respectively. While the problem of throughput optimized trajectories has been addressed in prior works, the formulation of an optimized trajectory to efficiently discover the propagation parameters has not yet been addressed. When it comes to the communication phase, the advantage of this paper comes from the exploitation of a 3-D city map. Unfortunately, the communication trajectory design based on the raw map data leads to an intractable optimization problem. To solve this issue, we introduce a map compression method that allows us to tackle the problem with standard optimization tools. The trajectory optimization is then combined with a node scheduling algorithm. The advantages of the learning-optimized trajectory and of the map compression method are illustrated in the context of intelligent Internet of Things data harvesting.},

In-N-Out can continuously charge a medical implant residing in deep tissues at near-optimal beamforming power, even when the implant moves around inside the human body. To accomplish this, we exploit the unique energy ball pattern of distributed antenna array and devise a backscatter-assisted beamforming algorithm that can concentrate RF energy on a tiny spot surrounding the medical implant. Meanwhile, the power levels on other body parts stay in low level, reducing the risk of overheating. We proto-type In-N-Out on 21 software-defined radios and a printed circuit board (PCB). Extensive experiments demonstrate that In-N-Out achieves 0.37 mW average charging power inside a 10 cm-thick pork belly, which is sufficient to wirelessly power a range of commercial medical devices. Our head-to-head comparison with the state-of-the-art approach shows that In-N-Out achieves 5.4X-18.1X power gain when the implant is stationary, and 5.3X-7.4X power gain when the implant is in motion.},

The sensor consists of a speaker and a microphone. It outputs a short duration sine wave probing sound to excite a container and its content, and then records the container's impulse response. SoQr then extracts Mean Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients from impulse response recordings of a container with different content levels and learns a support vector machine classifier. Results from a 10-fold cross validation of the prediction models on 19 common household items demonstrate that SoQr can correctly estimate the content level for these products with an average overall F-Measure above 0.96. We then further evaluated SoQr's robustness in different usage scenarios to gain an understanding of how the system performs and specific challenges that might arise when users interact with these products and the sensor.},

Answering unreliably or without the necessary information prevents adoption in diverse fields, with problems including fabrication of legal precedents               5               or untrue facts in news articles               6               and even posing a risk to human life in medical domains such as radiology               7               . Encouraging truthfulness through supervision or reinforcement has~been only partially successful               8               . Researchers need a general method for detecting hallucinations in LLMs that works even with new and unseen questions to which humans might not know the answer. Here we develop new methods grounded in statistics, proposing entropy-based uncertainty estimators for LLMs to detect a subset of hallucinations---confabulations---which are arbitrary and incorrect generations. Our method addresses the fact that one idea can be expressed in many ways by computing uncertainty at the level of meaning rather than specific sequences of words. Our method works across datasets and tasks without a priori knowledge of the task, requires no task-specific data and robustly generalizes to new tasks not seen before. By detecting when a prompt is likely to produce a confabulation, our method helps users understand when they must take extra care with LLMs and opens up new possibilities for using LLMs that are otherwise prevented by their unreliability.},

  abstract = {Facial authentication mechanisms are gaining traction on smartphones because of their convenience and increasingly good performance of face recognition systems. However, mainstream systems use traditional 2D face recognition technologies, which are vulnerable to various spoofing attacks. Existing systems perform liveness detection via specialized hardware, such as infrared dot projectors and dedicated cameras. Although effective, such methods do not align well with the smartphone industry's desire to maximize screen space. This paper presents a new liveness detection system, FaceRevelio, for commodity smartphones with a single front camera. It utilizes the smartphone screen to illuminate a user's face from multiple directions. The facial images captured under varying illumination enable the recovery of the face surface normals via photometric stereo, which can then be integrated into a 3D shape. We leverage the facial depth features of this 3D surface to distinguish a human face from its 2D counterpart. On top of this, we change the screen via a light passcode consisting of a combination of random light patterns to provide security against replay attacks. We evaluate FaceRevelio with 30 users trying to authenticate under various lighting conditions and with a series of 2D spoofing attacks. The results show that using a passcode of 1s, FaceRevelio achieves a mean EER of 1.4\% and 0.15\% against photo and video attacks, respectively.},

  abstract = {With rapid advances of scatter radio systems, the principle of reflection rather than active transmission employed by backscatter sensor networks, has emerged as a potential key enabler for low-cost, large-scale and dense ubiquitous sensor networks. Despite the presence of three different unknown channel links due to the bistatic setup (i.e., carrier emitter and receiver are dislocated), as well as multiple unknown scatter radio-related parameters, this work offers a novel coherent receiver of frequency-shift keying (FSK) modulation for the bistatic scatter radio channel. Furthermore, with the objective of range maximization, specific short block-length cyclic channel codes are utilized. The proposed approach requires minimum encoding complexity, ideal for resource-constrained, ultra-low power (e.g. microcontroller unit-based), low-bit rate scatter radio tags, adheres to simple low-complexity decoding at the receiver and achieves high-order signal diversity. Analysis is followed by experimental validation with a commodity software-defined radio (SDR) reader and a custom scatter radio tag; tag-to-reader ranges up to 150 meters are demonstrated with as little as 20 milliWatt transmission power, increasing sensing ranges by approximately 10 additional meters, compared to state-of-the-art bistatic scatter radio receivers. With the imminent emergence of backscatter sensor networks, this work serves as a small step forward towards the realization of low-cost, low-power, increased-range, wireless sensing applications.},

In this work, we undertake the challenging problem of identifying location of obstacles and objects by WiFi signals. Gathering wireless sensory data to form an image is difficult since wireless signals are susceptible to multipath. Moreover, reconstructing an image of unknown objects based on the measurements of sparse signals is an ill-posed problem. To tackle these problems, we first present a linear model using received signal strength indicator (RSSI) measurements. We define the sparse beamforming problem as an 0-norm optimization problem, then use the iterative reweighted 1 heuristic algorithm to obtain an optimal solution as a multipath. Finally, the multipath fading is removed by using Machine Learning. More specifically, we use Support Vector Regression (SVR) to identify a clear image of the unknown object. Our results show that the proposed method can reconstruct signals as a 3D image with a satisfactory visual appearance, i.e. the generated data mesh is well defined and smooth compared to previous work.},

  abstract = {The micro-nano-scale science is rapidly developing. In order to study the properties of micro-nano-scale particles by the optical method, we discuss the scattering effects of sub-micrometer wires and sub-micrometer balls on photo-electromagnetic wave in this paper. For the optical scattering of micro-nano-scale particles, the scattering particle size can meet the Mie scattering conditions compared with the incident light wavelength, that is to say, the scatterer and the incident wavelength have comparable size. In this article, the analysis results are clearly displayed in the form of simulation graphs obtained by the Matlab numerical simulation. The Mie scattering analysis method can be used for discussing the scattering of electromagnetic waves in the cases of layered particles which meet the size requirements and any number of scattering particles. Multi-particle scattering is analyzed to investigate the effects of scatterers at different positions on the scattering. By analyzing the differential scattering cross section and the electromagnetic field distribution of near-field scattering related to the scattering light field, we obtain the variation trend of the scattering light field with scattering angle and the effects of various factors on the scattering light field, including the polarization of incident wave, the size of the scatterer, the structure of scattering particles, the number of particles, the number of scattering particles, and some hidden factors such as the relative refractive index of scatterer and surrounding medium. The scientific significance of the paper is reflected through the fact that the sub-micron scale particle can be used as a sensor of detecting the displacement, which can be realized by optical means. So it has a certain reference value for studying the influence of particle own characteristic on the scattering light, thereby rendering the optical readout of the mechanical displacement very accurate. The obtained results have a guiding significance for studying the optical detection of mechanical vibrations of sub-micron wires.},

Then, we present our two schemes (PRSCG and PRSCG-TF) based on CGs according to different scenarios. In order to conduct numerical calculation, we transfer original CGs into their linear form with some modification and map them to numerical vectors. Second, we employ the technology of multi-keyword ranked search over encrypted cloud data as the basis against two threat models and raise PRSCG and PRSCG-TF to resolve the problem of privacy-preserving smart semantic search based on CGs. Finally, we choose a real-world data set: CNN data set to test our scheme. We also analyze the privacy and efficiency of proposed schemes in detail. The experiment results show that our proposed schemes are efficient.},

The UAVs are assumed as intelligent agents which can adaptively adjust their three dimensional (3D) deployment to maximize the channel capacity of the multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system. Specifically, for the limitations of each UAV in accessing the global information, we consider a decentralized control strategy and divide the optimization problem into several optimization sub-problems, and then formulated into a UAVs channel capacity game. We analyze such game according to the designed reward function and the potential function. Then, we discuss the existence of the pure Nash equilibrium in the game. To achieve the best Nash equilibrium of the MIMO system, we develop a decentralized learning algorithm, namely decentralized UAVs channel capacity learning. The details of the algorithm is provided and the convergence of the algorithm is analyzed. In the meanwhile, we give some insightful remarks. The simulations show that the developed learning algorithm can achieve a high channel capacity than the benchmark methods.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate that a popular class of nonparametric mutual information (MI) estimators based on k-nearest-neighbor graphs requires number of samples that scales exponentially with the true MI. Consequently, accurate estimation of MI between two strongly dependent variables is possible only for prohibitively large sample size. This important yet overlooked shortcoming of the existing estimators is due to their implicit reliance on local uniformity of the underlying joint distribution. We introduce a new estimator that is robust to local non-uniformity, works well with limited data, and is able to capture relationship strengths over many orders of magnitude. We demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed estimator on both synthetic and real-world data.},

The most popular estimator is the one proposed by Kraskov, St{\"o}gbauer, and Grassberger (KSG) in 2004 and is nonparametric and based on the distances of each sample to its kth nearest neighboring sample, where k is a fixed small integer. Despite of its widespread use (part of scientific software packages), theoretical properties of this estimator have been largely unexplored. In this paper, we demonstrate that the estimator is consistent and also identify an upper bound on the rate of convergence of the 2 error as a function of a number of samples. We argue that the performance benefits of the KSG estimator stems from a curious ``correlation boosting'' effect and build on this intuition to modify the KSG estimator in novel ways to construct a superior estimator. As a by-product of our investigations, we obtain nearly tight rates of convergence of the 2 error of the well-known fixed k-nearest neighbor estimator of differential entropy by Kozachenko and Leonenko.},

  abstract = {Estimation of mutual information from observed samples is a basic primitive in machine learning, useful in several learning tasks including correlation mining, information bottleneck, Chow-Liu tree, and conditional independence testing in (causal) graphical models. While mutual information is a quantity well-defined for general probability spaces, estimators have been developed only in the special case of discrete or continuous pairs of random variables. Most of these estimators operate using the 3H-principle, i.e., by calculating the three (differential) entropies of X, Y and the pair (X, Y ). However, in general mixture spaces, such individual entropies are not well defined, even though mutual information is. In this paper, we develop a novel estimator for estimating mutual information in discrete-continuous mixtures. We prove the consistency of this estimator theoretically as well as demonstrate its excellent empirical performance. This problem is relevant in a wide-array of applications, where some variables are discrete, some continuous, and others are a mixture between continuous and discrete components.},

Unfortunately, establishing multi-stream directional links can be a high overhead procedure as the search space increases with the number of spatial streams and the product of AP-client beam resolution. In this paper, we present MUlti-stream beam-Training for mm-wavE networks (MUTE) a novel system that leverages channel sparsity, GHz-scale sampling rate, and the knowledge of mm-Wave RF codebook beam patterns to construct a set of candidate beams for multi-stream beam steering. In 60 GHz WLANs, the AP establishes and maintains a directional link with every client through periodic beam training. MUTE repurposes these beam acquisition sweeps to estimate the Power Delay Profile (PDP) of each beam with zero additional overhead. Coupling PDP estimates with beam pattern knowledge, MUTE selects a set of candidate beams that capture diverse or ideally orthogonal paths to obtain maximum stream separability. Our experiments demonstrate that MUTE achieves 90\% of the maximum achievable aggregate rate while incurring only 0.04\% of exhaustive search's training overhead.},

  abstract = {This article studies remote sensing image retrieval using kernel-based support vector data description (SVDD). We exploit deep SVDD, which is a well-known method for one-class classification to recover the most relevant samples from the archive. To this end, a deep neural network (DNN) is jointly trained to map the data into a hypersphere of minimum volume in the latent space. It is expected that similar samples to the query are compressed inside of the hypersphere. The closest embedding to the center of the hypersphere is related to the most relevant sample to query. We enhance deep SVDD by injecting the statistical information of data to the DNN by means of additional terms in the cost function. The first enhancement method takes advantage of covariance regularization of batches of the training set to penalize unnecessary redundancy and minimize the correlation between the different dimensions of the embedding. The second method involves unlocking the hypersphere's predefined center while preventing network divergence during training. Therefore, two parameters are designed to control the importance of the drifting of the center and the importance of a fixed predefined center (convergence), respectively. This has been implemented by considering the average of batches of embedding in each iteration as the updated center. This pushes irrelevant samples away from query samples, making data clustering easier for the DNN. The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated on benchmark datasets.},

Such systems, exploiting the fine delay resolution properties of wideband and ultra-wideband (UWB) signals, are particularly attractive for ranging under harsh propagation conditions in which significant multipath may be present. While multipath has been traditionally considered detrimental in the design of TOA estimators, it can be exploited to benefit ranging. This paper investigates the impact of a priori multipath information on TOA estimation. To this end, bounds on the performance of TOA estimation in dense multipath channels are provided and discussed under different operating conditions. The effects of channel dispersion and transmission bandwidth on ranging systems are investigated showing that, contrary to communication systems, diversity behavior is only exhibited in the medium signal-to-noise ratio regime.},

A simple testing scheme is used which is almost as efficient as point-matching. Numerical results indicate that the approach is free of anomalies in the behavior of current near edges and of other previously observed numerical instabilities.

It is shown that the localization estimation accuracy can be approximated as inversely proportional to the carrier frequency in the coherent case.

We compute modified Cram{\'e}r-Rao lower bounds (MCRLB) for the target parameter (delay, Doppler) estimation error using universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) signals as illuminators of opportunity for passive multistatic radar systems. We consider both coherent and non-coherent processing modes. These expressions for MCRLB are an important performance metric in that they enable the selection of the optimal illuminators for estimation.},

  abstract = {Continual Learning (CL) methods aim to enable machine learning models to learn new tasks without catastrophic forgetting of those that have been previously mastered. Existing CL approaches often keep a buffer of previously-seen samples, perform knowledge distillation, or use regularization techniques towards this goal. Despite their performance, they still suffer from interference across tasks which leads to catastrophic forgetting. To ameliorate this problem, we propose to only activate and select sparse neurons for learning current and past tasks at any stage. More parameters space and model capacity can thus be reserved for the future tasks. This minimizes the interference between parameters for different tasks. To do so, we propose a Sparse neural Network for Continual Learning (SNCL), which employs variational Bayesian sparsity priors on the activations of the neurons in all layers. Full Experience Replay (FER) provides effective supervision in learning the sparse activations of the neurons in different layers. A loss-aware reservoir-sampling strategy is developed to maintain the memory buffer. The proposed method is agnostic as to the network structures and the task boundaries. Experiments on different datasets show that SNCL achieves state-of-the-art result for mitigating forgetting.},

In this paper, we consider a backscatter communication network, in which the passive radio uses the harvested energy from a power beacon station (PBS) to supply its data transmissions, while some other radios can help as the wireless relays. To improve the throughput performance of a distant transceiver pair, we propose a two-hop backscatter relay model and formulate a throughput maximization problem to jointly optimize WPT and the relay strategies. Noting that the proposed problem is non-convex, an iterative algorithm with reduced complexity is proposed to decompose the original problem into a power allocation subproblem in the outer loop and an optimization of the relay strategy in the inner loop. Numerical results reveal that the power allocation converges to the optimum and the relay strategy significantly improves the throughput when the radios' power demand is low.},

Human body responses are manifested through multiple, interacting modalities -- the mechanical, electrical and chemical; yet, current physiological monitors (e.g. actigraphy, heart rate) largely lack in cross-modal ability, are inconvenient and/or stigmatizing. We address these challenges through an               inconspicuous               earpiece, which benefits from the relatively stable position of the ear canal with respect to vital organs. Equipped with miniature multimodal sensors, it robustly measures the brain, cardiac and respiratory functions. Comprehensive experiments validate each modality within the proposed earpiece, while its potential in wearable health monitoring is illustrated through case studies spanning these three functions. We further demonstrate how combining data from multiple sensors within such an integrated wearable device improves both the accuracy of measurements and the ability to deal with artifacts in real-world scenarios.},

Specifically, the paper derives, from the fundamental physical point of view of Maxwell's equations describing electromagnetic fields, the Shannon information capacity of space-time wireless channels formed by electromagnetic sources and receivers in a known background medium. The theory is developed first for the case of sources working at a fixed frequency (time-harmonic case) and is expanded later to the more general case of temporally bandlimited systems (time-domain fields). In the bandlimited case we consider separately the two cases of time-limited and essentially bandlimited systems and of purely bandlimited systems. The developments take into account the physical radiated power constraint in addition to a constraint in the source L 2 norm which acts to avoid antenna superdirectivity. Based on such radiated power and current L 2 norm constraints we derive the Shannon information capacity of canonical wireless and antenna systems in free space, for a given additive Gaussian noise level, as well as an associated number of degrees of freedom resulting from such capacity calculations. The derived results also illustrate, from a new information-theoretic point of view, the transition from near to far fields.},

Most current works mainly focus on modeling body shape from multimodality information (e.g., silhouettes and sketches), but do not make full use of the clothes-irrelevant information in the original RGB images. In this paper, we propose a Clothes-based Adversarial Loss (CAL) to mine clothesirrelevant features from the original RGB images by penalizing the predictive power of re-id model w.r.t. clothes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that using RGB images only, CAL outperforms all state-of-the-art methods on widely-used clothes-changing person re-id benchmarks. Besides, compared with images, videos contain richer appearance and additional temporal information, which can be used to model proper spatiotemporal patterns to assist clothes-changing re-id. Since there is no publicly available clothes-changing video re-id dataset, we contribute a new dataset named CCVID and show that there exists much room for improvement in modeling spatiotemporal information. The code and new dataset are available at: https: //github.com/guxinqian/Simple-CCReID.},

  abstract = {The rapid evolution of the International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT) landscape has prompted the International Telecommunications Union Working Party 5D (ITU WP 5D) to outline the framework for IMT-2030 and beyond. This next-generation initiative seeks to meet the diverse demands of future networks, with key objectives including hyper-low latency, enhanced energy efficiency, and robust support for high mobility. Current 5th generation (5G) technologies employ waveforms like Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and Discrete Fourier Transform Spread Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (DFT-s-OFDM). However, these waveforms are insufficient to fully meet the stringent requirements of nextgeneration communication systems. This paper introduces a novel waveform, Orthogonal Time Frequency Division Multiplexing (OTFDM), designed to address the limitations of existing waveforms. OTFDM achieves ultra-low latency by enabling single-shot transmission of data and Reference Signals (RS) within a single symbol. Furthermore, OTFDM supports high mobility with improved resilience to Doppler shifts and enhances power amplifier efficiency through its low Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) characteristics. The proposed waveform incorporates advanced signal processing techniques, including time-frequency multiplexing and frequency domain spectrum shaping, to mitigate inter-symbol interference (ISI). These techniques enable accurate per-symbol channel estimation, thus supporting higher-order modulations even at higher user speeds. Extensive simulations validate the efficacy of OTFDM, demonstrating its capability to support user speeds up to 500 Km/h with minimal RS overhead. This paper explores the technical aspects of OTFDM and discusses its potential implications for the next-generation wireless communication systems.},

  abstract = {Backscatter communication (BackCom), which allows a backscatter node (BN) to communicate with the reader by modulating and reflecting the incident continuous wave from the reader, is considered a promising solution to power the future Internet-of-Things. In this paper, we consider a single BackCom system, where multiple BNs are served by a reader. We propose using the power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), i.e., multiplexing the BNs in different regions or with different backscattered power levels, to enhance the spectrum efficiency of the BackCom system. To better exploit power-domain NOMA, we propose setting the reflection coefficients for multiplexed BNs to be different. Based on this considered model, we develop the reflection coefficient selection criteria. To illustrate the enhanced system with the proposed criteria, we analyze the performance of the BackCom system in terms of the average number of bits that can be successfully decoded by the reader for the two-node pairing case and the average number of successful BNs for the general multiplexing case. Our results show that NOMA achieves the much better performance gain in the BackCom system as compared to its performance gain in the conventional system, which highlights the importance of applying NOMA to the BackCom system.},

We focus on a sub-6 GHz scenario in which the channel propagation is not sparse and the number of IRS elements can be larger than the number of BS antennas. A novel channel estimation protocol without the need for on-off amplitude control to avoid the reflection power loss is proposed. The pilot overhead is substantially reduced by exploiting the common-link structure to decompose the cascaded channel coefficients by the multiplication of the common-link variables and the user-specific variables. However, these two types of variables are highly coupled, which makes them difficult to estimate. To address this issue, we formulate an optimization-based joint channel estimation problem, which only utilizes the covariance of the cascaded channel. Then, we design a low-complexity alternating optimization algorithm with efficient initialization for the non-convex optimization problem, which achieves a local optimum solution. To further enhance the estimation accuracy, we propose a new formulation to optimize the training phase shifting configuration for the proposed protocol, and then we solve it using the successive convex approximation algorithm. Comprehensive simulations verify that the proposed algorithm has supreme performance compared to various state-of-the-art baseline schemes.},

  abstract = {In recent years, radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting has attracted more and more attention. Many different types of RF fingerprints have been proposed, such as carrier frequency offset (CFO), sampling frequency offset and error vector magnitude. Among them, the CFO fingerprint is recognized as a promising RF fingerprint. However, for commonly used smartphones, we find that its CFO fingerprint is unstable, because the temperature of crystal oscillator varies greatly and large fluctuations of temperature significantly affect its CFO fingerprint. Therefore, the solutions of CFO-based fingerprinting will no longer be effective for smartphones if the temperature of crystal oscillator is not involved. To this end, we propose a more reliable and applicable CFO-based fingerprinting approach called temperature-aware radio frequency fingerprinting (TeRFF). First, we construct a dataset by extracting crystal oscillator's temperature and the corresponding CFO value on multiple smartphones over a period. In the dataset, the extracted temperature values constitute a set of temperature values, and each registered temperature value corresponds to a group of CFO samples. On this basis, we train multiple Naive Bayes models, each tagged with a registered temperature value. Moreover, since there are many temperature values which are not in the temperature set, we design a CFO estimation method to estimate the CFO fingerprint at the unregistered temperature. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed solution TeRFF makes the CFO fingerprinting still effective for smartphone identification, and its performance is better than other existing RF fingerprinting schemes.},

Through this design, which exploits full diversity over time and frequency, OTFS converts the fading, time-varying wireless channel experienced by modulated signals such as OFDM into a time-independent channel with a complex channel gain that is roughly constant for all symbols. This property allows OTFS to greatly simplify system operation and significantly improves performance, particular in systems with high Doppler, short packets, and large antenna arrays. Simulation results indicate at least several dB of block error rate performance improvement for OTFS over OFDM in all of these settings. In addition these results show that even at very high Dopplers (500 km/h), OTFS approaches channel capacity through linear scaling of throughput with the MIMO order, whereas the performance of OFDM under typical design parameters breaks down completely.},

Prior research demonstrates that physical layer information based authentication is a promising solution, which uses special features from the physical backscatter signals from tags as their fingerprints. However, our recent studies show that existing physical-layer authentication may fail if feature collection and authentication are conducted in different locations, due to location-dependent noises, environmental factors, or reader hardware differences.             This paper presents a new physical layer authentication scheme, called Butterfly, which is resilient to environment and location changes. Butterfly utilizes a pair of adjacent tags as an identifier of each object. By using the difference between the RF signals of the two tags as their fingerprint, the environmental factors can be effectively canceled. Butterfly is fully compatible with commodity RFID systems and standards. We set up a prototype Butterfly using commodity readers, tags, and RF devices. Extensive experiments show that Butterfly achieves high authentication accuracy for substantially different environments and device changes.},

The possible axis orientations of very long cylinders is limited by the conical shape of the scattering patterns, and the manner of taking this into account in the averaging process is detailed. It is found that the scattering intensities for the scattering of light from randomly oriented long cylinders, with aspect ratios (length/diameter) less than about 200, show differences compared with infinite cylinders of the same radius and dielectric constant (m=1.5). This is especially true for high and low scattering angles and when the plane of linear polarization is changed by the scattering. Moreover, the scattering intensities for the scattering of light from randomly oriented short cylinders and spheroids, with aspect ratios ranging from 0.1 to 10 and the same volume, show significant differences when the plane of polarization is changed by the scattering.},

  abstract = {Microwave nonresonant methods generally require some sort of calibration before conducting the measurements. Calibration-independent nonresonant methods are very attractive since they eliminate this need. In the literature, different calibration-independent methods for complex permittivity determination of materials have been proposed. While some of them use uncalibrated S-parameter measurements of two identical samples with different lengths, the others utilize the same measurements of one sample. The advantage of the latter methods is that they eliminate any impurity and/or inhomogeneity present in the second sample and avoid any thickness uncertainty that can arise from using the second sample. In the literature, the proposed approaches in latter methods, however, require precise location of the sample inside its cell (a waveguide or coaxial-line section) or exact shifting distance of the sample inside its cell. This letter proposes a method to eliminate these requirements using uncalibrated S-parameter measurements of an extra cell (empty) and the cell, in which the sample is arbitrarily located.},

Moreover, Fusang constructs two novel graphstructured features to robustly represent the reflected responses of the signal in the frequency domain and IQ domain, and carefully designs a neural network to accurately recognize objects even in different multipath scenarios. We have implemented a prototype of Fusang on a commodity mmWave Radar device. Our experiments with 24 different objects show that Fusang achieves a mean accuracy of 97\% in different multipath environments. The code, dataset, and trained models of Fusang can be obtained at https://github.com/ OpenNISLab/Pro-Fusang.},

We conduct a comparison of six high-resolution, daily and monthly gridded precipitation datasets over the Western United States. We compare the long-term average spatial patterns, and interannual variability of water-year total precipitation, as well as multi-year trends in precipitation across the datasets. We find that the greatest absolute differences among datasets occur in high-elevation areas and in the maritime mountain ranges of the Western United States, while the greatest percent differences among datasets relative to annual total precipitation occur in arid and rain-shadowed areas. Differences between datasets in some high-elevation areas exceed 200mmyr-1 on average, and relative differences range from 5 to 60\% across the Western United States. In areas of high topographic relief, true uncertainties and biases are likely higher than the differences among the datasets; we present evidence of this based on streamflow observations. Precipitation trends in the datasets differ in magnitude and sign at smaller scales, and are sensitive to how temporal inhomogeneities in the underlying precipitation gauge data are handled.},

  abstract = {Privacy enforcement has been one of the most important challenges in IT area. Current privacy practices within companies and organizations, e.g. enabling a P3P compliant policy, incorporating a privacy seal program, etc., cannot truly protect consumer privacy. Privacy protection can only be achieved by enforcing privacy policies within an organizations online and offline data processing systems. Traditional security models are more or less inappropriate for enforcing basic privacy requirements, such as purpose binding. This paper proposes an extended role-based access control (RBAC) model, called Privacy-Aware Role-Based Access Control (PARBAC) model, for enforcing privacy policies within an organization. The PARBAC model combines RBAC, Domain-Type Enforcement, and privacy protection by modeling business purposes and data policies. Consented consumer privacy preferences are recorded as data policies, which govern how to use actual consumer data. One of the key elements in a privacy policy is purpose. The actual purpose of a business operation to consumer data must be consistent with the purpose consented by the consumer. This is the so-called purpose binding privacy requirement. This paper focuses on enforcing this requirement. Privacy enforcement mechanism with the PARBAC model is then discussed and a privacy scenario is illustrated to describe its application.}

Our analysis of 31,855 mobile phone users allowed us to infer that people were more likely to stay longer at eateries or food outlets, and (to a lesser degree) at retail or shopping areas when the weather is very cold or when conditions are calm (non-windy). When compared to people's regular activity patterns, certain weather conditions affected people's movements and activities noticeably at different times of the day. On cold days, people's activities were found to be more diverse especially after 10AM, showing greatest variations between 2PM and 6PM. A similar trend is observed between 10AM and midnight on rainy days, with people's activities found to be most diverse on days with heaviest rainfalls or on days when the wind speed was stronger than 4 km/h, especially between 10AM--1AM. Finally, we observed that different geographical areas of a large metropolis were impacted differently by the weather. Using data of urban infrastructure to characterize areas, we found strong correlations between weather conditions upon people's accessibility to trains. This study sheds new light on the influence of weather conditions on human behavior, in particular the choice of daily activities and how mobile phone data can be used to investigate the influence of environmental factors on urban dynamics.},

For example, social researchers are interested in studying domestic abuse, and healthcare professionals are interested in caregiver-patient interaction. Today, such studies rely on diaries and questionnaires, which are subjective, erroneous, and hard to sustain in longitudinal studies. We introduce Marko, a system that automatically collects behavior-related data, without asking people to write diaries or wear sensors. Marko transmits a low power wireless signal and analyses its reflections from the environment. It maps those reflections to how users interact with the environment (e.g., access to medication cabinet) and with each other (e.g., watch TV together). It provides novel algorithms for identifying who-does-what, and bootstrapping the system in new homes without asking users for new annotations. We evaluate Marko with a one-month deployment in six homes, and demonstrate its value for studying couple relationships and caregiver-patient interaction.},

The conventional deep convolutional neural networks based methods usually take the amplitude information of single-polarization SAR images as the input to learn hierarchical spatial features automatically, which may have difficulties in discriminating objects with similar texture but discriminative scattering patterns. Our novel deep learning framework, Deep SAR-Net, takes complex-valued SAR images into consideration to learn both spatial texture information and backscattering patterns of objects on the ground. On the one hand, we transfer the detected SAR images pre-trained layers to extract spatial features from intensity images. On the other hand, we dig into the Fourier domain to learn physical properties of the objects by joint time-frequency analysis on complex-valued SAR images. We evaluate the effectiveness of Deep SAR-Net on three complex-valued SAR datasets from Sentinel-1 and TerraSAR-X satellite and demonstrate how it works better than conventional deep CNNs, especially on man-made objects classes. The proposed datasets and the trained Deep SAR-Net model with all codes are provided.},

It comprises three parts: (1) explainable models (XM) to provide prior physics knowledge, (2) physics guided network (PGN) to encode the knowledge into physics-aware features, and (3) physics injected network (PIN) to adaptively introduce the physics-aware features into classification pipeline for label prediction. A hybrid Image-Physics SAR dataset format is proposed for evaluation, with both Sentinel-1 and Gaofen-3 SAR data being experimented. The results show that the proposed PGIL substantially improve the classification performance in case of limited labeled data compared with the counterpart data-driven CNN and other pre-training methods. Additionally, the physics explanations are discussed to indicate the interpretability and the physical consistency preserved in the predictions. We deem the proposed method would promote the development of physically explainable deep learning in SAR image interpretation field.},

Among various methods, large-scale, gradient-based optimization techniques have been one of the most important ways to design a structure containing a vast number of degrees of freedom. These techniques are made possible by the adjoint method, in which the gradient of an objective function with respect to all design degrees of freedom can be computed using only two full-field simulations. However, this approach has so far mostly been applied to linear photonic devices. Here, we present an extension of this method to modeling nonlinear devices in the frequency domain, with the nonlinear response directly included in the gradient computation. As illustrations, we use the method to devise compact photonic switches in a Kerr nonlinear material, in which low-power and high-power pulses are routed in different directions. Our technique may lead to the development of novel compact nonlinear photonic devices.},

Furthermore, it provides an exact alternative to numerical derivative methods, based on finite-difference approximations. To demonstrate the usefulness of the method, we perform sensitivity analysis of two problems. First we compute how the spatial near-field intensity distribution of a scatterer changes with respect to its dielectric constant. Then, we compute how the spectral power and coupling efficiency of a surface grating coupler changes with respect to its fill factor.},

According to our field test, our tunnel diode-based FM tag can achieve the 20-m communication range under FM signal strength of -50 dBm, which is much longer than the traditional FM backscatter tag.},

  abstract = {The objective of this work is to segment high-resolution images without overloading GPU memory usage or losing the fine details in the output segmentation map. The memory constraint means that we must either downsample the big image or divide the image into local patches for separate processing. However, the former approach would lose the fine details, while the latter can be ambiguous due to the lack of a global picture. In this work, we present MagNet, a multi-scale framework that resolves local ambiguity by looking at the image at multiple magnification levels. MagNet has multiple processing stages, where each stage corresponds to a magnification level, and the output of one stage is fed into the next stage for coarse-to-fine information propagation. Each stage analyzes the image at a higher resolution than the previous stage, recovering the previously lost details due to the lossy downsampling step, and the segmentation output is progressively refined through the processing stages. Experiments on three high-resolution datasets of urban views, aerial scenes, and medical images show that MagNet consistently outperforms the state-of-theart methods by a significant margin.

We analyze the key factors and parameters that affect the ranging performance and revisit standard error correction techniques for WiFi time-based ranging system.

  abstract = {Low-cost in-baggage object identification is highly demanded in enhancing public safety and smart manufacturing. Existing approaches usually require specialized equipment and heavy deployment overhead, making them hard to scale for wide deployment. The recent WiFi-based approach is unsuitable for practical deployment as it did not address dynamic environmental impacts. In this work, we propose an environment-independent in-baggage object identification system by leveraging low-cost WiFi. We exploit the channel state information (CSI) to capture material and shape characteristics to facilitate fine-grained inbaggage object identification. A major challenge of building such a system is that CSI measurements are sensitive to real-world dynamics, such as different types of baggage, time-varying ambient noises and interferences, and different deployment environments. To tackle these problems, we develop WiFi features based on polarized directional antennas that can capture objects' material and shape characteristics. A convolutional neural network-based model is developed to constructively integrate the WiFi features and perform accurate in-baggage object identification. We also develop a material-based domain adaptation using adversarial learning to facilitate fast deployments in different environments. We conduct extensive experiments involving 14 representation objects, 4 types of bags in 3 different room environments. The results show that our system can achieve over 97\% in the same environment, and our domain adaptation method can improve the object identification accuracy by 42\% when the system is deployed in a new environment with little training.},

The increased SINR is not only due to a larger gain in the direction of the desired user, but also due to a better control of the spatial distribution of interference in the cell. To further enhance the system performance not only the horizontal, but also the vertical dimension can be exploited for beam pattern adaptation, thus giving an additional degree of freedom for interference avoidance among adjacent cells. This horizontal and vertical beam pattern adaptation is also referred to as 3D beamforming in the following. This paper describes investigations of the potential of 3D beamforming with lab and field trial setups and provides initial performance results.},

The overall treatment is separated into two stages: at the first stage, scattering from a single cylinder is obtained as the first-order solution; and at the second stage, a recursive process that accounts for multiple scattering, where the scattered field from one cylinder is considered as the illuminating wave for the other cylinder and vice verse, is formed. The procedure is found to converge very fast except for the case when any pair of cylinders is very close to each other. It should be noted that since no approximation is introduced in the procedure, this approach is thus more rigorous. Moreover, the formalism is general and can be readily applied to cylinders with cross section other than circular so long as the T matrix of each sub-cylinder can be accurately obtained. The validity of the proposed method has been verified by good agreement between model results and numerical simulations.},

For the purpose of exposition, we consider a two-user WPCN, in which one hybrid access point (H-AP) broadcasts wireless energy to two distributed users in the downlink (DL) and the users transmit their independent information using their individually harvested energy to the H-AP in the uplink (UL) through time-division-multiple-access (TDMA). We propose user cooperation in the WPCN where the user that is nearer to the H-AP and in general has a better channel for DL energy harvesting as well as UL information transmission uses part of its allocated UL time and DL harvested energy to help relay the far user's information to the H-AP, in order to achieve more balanced throughput. We maximize the weighted sum-rate (WSR) of the two users by jointly optimizing the time and power allocations in the network for both wireless energy transfer in the DL and wireless information transmission and relaying in the UL. Simulation results show that the proposed user cooperation scheme can effectively improve the achievable throughput in the WPCN with desired user fairness.},

  abstract = {For today's computer users, the mouse plays such an important role that it dominates the interaction interface in personal computer for nearly half a century since it was invented. However, the mouse is gradually unfit for the demand of modern 3D display techniques, e.g. 3D-projection or -screen, for the reason that the relevant interactions are confined in a surface. Although some new methods such as computer vision based techniques attempt to bridge the human-computer barrier, they suffer from many limitations such as ambiguity in multitargets and dependence on light. This paper presents a battery-free device called Tagball for 3D human-computer interaction via RFID tags. Tagball devises a control ball, on which N passive tags are attached, for users to generate two basic kinds of interactive commands: translation and rotation. Instead of locating N tags independently, we model the ball as a whole in a more cooperative way under the circumstance that their geometric relationships are known in advance. In addition, we consider the phase values measured by M RF antennas for these N tags as observations of the ball state. Our key innovations are the studies on motion behaviors of a group of tags by using Extended Kalman Filter, and the implementation based on purely Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) RFID products. The systematical evaluation shows that Tagball traces the ball translation to 1.5cm and identifies ball orientation to 1.8{$^\circ$} in 3D space.},

Although effective in recognizing an isolated object, as was shown by Murase and Nayar; the current method can not be applied to piratically occluded objects that are typical in bin-picking tasks. The analysis also requires that the object is centered in an image before recognition. These limitations of the eigen-space analysis are due to the fact that the whole appearance of an object is utilized as a template f o r the analysis. We propose a new method, referred to as the ``eigen-window'' method, that stores multiple partial appearances of an object in the eigen-space. Such partial appearances require a large number of memory space. To reduce the memory requirement by avoiding redundant windows and to select only effective windows to be stored, a similarity measure among windows is developed. Using a pose clustering method among windows, the method determines the pose of an object. We have implemented the method and verify the validity of the method.},

Secondly, using a plane-wave spectrum expansion of a generic electromagnetic wave combined with Nyquist sampling theorem in the spatial domain, we show that the laws of electromagnetism limit the minimum antenna spacing to half a wavelength,   / 2 , (in the case of 1-D antenna apertures) only asymptotically, when the number of antennas n     . For a finite number of antennas, this limit is slightly less than   / 2 . In any case, the number of antennas and, consequently, the MIMO capacity is limited for a given aperture size.

The present paper introduces the nnU-Net ('no-new-Net'), which refers to a robust and self-adapting framework on the basis of 2D and 3D vanilla U-Nets. We argue the strong case for taking away superfluous bells and whistles of many proposed network designs and instead focus on the remaining aspects that make out the performance and generalizability of a method. We evaluate the nnU-Net in the context of the Medical Segmentation Decathlon challenge, which measures segmentation performance in ten disciplines comprising distinct entities, image modalities, image geometries and dataset sizes, with no manual adjustments between datasets allowed. At the time of manuscript submission, nnU-Net achieves the highest mean dice scores across all classes and seven phase 1 tasks (except class 1 in BrainTumour) in the online leaderboard of the challenge.},

In addition to the challenges of achieving low-power consumption and long-range communication, airdropping wireless sensors is difficult because it requires the sensor to survive the impact when dropped in mid-air. Our design takes inspiration from nature: small insects like ants can fall from tall buildings and survive because of their tiny mass and size. Inspired by this, we design insect-scale wireless sensors that come fully integrated with an onboard power supply and a lightweight mechanical actuator to detach from the aerial platform. Our system introduces a first-of-its-kind 37 mg mechanical release mechanism to drop the sensor during flight, using only 450 {$\mu$}J of energy as well as a wireless communication link that can transmit sensor data at 33 kbps up to 1 km. Once deployed, our 98 mg wireless sensor can run for 1.3-2.5 years when transmitting 10-50 packets per hour on a 68 mg battery. We demonstrate attachment to a small 28 mm wide drone and a moth (Manduca sexta) and show that our insect-scale sensors flutter as they fall, suffering no damage on impact onto a tile floor from heights of 22 m.},

We analyzed the recently proposed algorithms for inpainting-based 3D view synthesis and observed that these algorithms no longer produce stretching and black holes. However, the existing databases such as IETR, IVC, and IVY have 3Dgenerated views with these artifacts. This observation suggests that the existing 3D view synthesis quality assessment algorithms can not judge the quality of most recent 3D synthesized views. With this view, through this abstract, we analyze the need for a new large-scale database and a new perceptual quality metric oriented for 3D views using a test dataset.},

PAB relies on the piezoelectric effect to enable underwater communication and sensing at near-zero power. Its architecture is inspired by radio backscatter which works well in air but cannot work well underwater due to the exponential attenuation of radio signals in water. PAB nodes harvest energy from underwater acoustic signals using piezoelectric interfaces and communicate by modulating the piezoelectric impedance. Our design introduces innovations that enable concurrent multiple access through circuit-based frequency tuning of backscatter modulation and a MAC that exploits the properties of PAB nodes to deliver higher network throughput and decode network collisions. We built a prototype of our design using custom-designed, mechanically fabricated transducers and an end-to-end battery-free hardware implementation. We tested our nodes in large experimental water tanks at the MIT Sea Grant. Our results demonstrate single-link throughputs up to 3 kbps and power-up ranges up to 10 m. Finally, we show how our design can be used to measure acidity, temperature, and pressure. Looking ahead, the system can be used in ocean exploration, marine life sensing, and underwater climate change monitoring.},

This work re-interprets grasping as rendering and introduces NeuGraspNet, a novel method for 6DoF grasp detection that leverages advances in neural volumetric representations and surface rendering. We encode the interaction between a robot's end-effector and an object's surface by jointly learning to render the local object surface and learning grasping functions in a shared feature space. Our approach uses global (scenelevel) features for grasp generation and local (grasp-level) neural surface features for grasp evaluation. This enables effective, fully implicit 6DoF grasp quality prediction, even in partially observed scenes. NeuGraspNet operates on random viewpoints, common in mobile manipulation scenarios, and outperforms existing implicit and semi-implicit grasping methods. We demonstrate the realworld applicability of the method with a mobile manipulator robot, grasping in open cluttered spaces.},

  abstract = {Driven by a wide range of real-world applications, significant efforts have recently been made to explore device-free human activity recognition techniques that utilize the information collected by various wireless infrastructures to infer human activities without the need for the monitored subject to carry a dedicated device. Existing device free human activity recognition approaches and systems, though yielding reasonably good performance in certain cases, are faced with a major challenge. The wireless signals arriving at the receiving devices usually carry substantial information that is specific to the environment where the activities are recorded and the human subject who conducts the activities. Due to this reason, an activity recognition model that is trained on a specific subject in a specific environment typically does not work well when being applied to predict another subject's activities that are recorded in a different environment. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose EI, a deep-learning based device free activity recognition framework that can remove the environment and subject specific information contained in the activity data and extract environment/subject-independent features shared by the data collected on different subjects under different environments. We conduct extensive experiments on four different device free activity recognition testbeds: WiFi, ultrasound, 60 GHz mmWave, and visible light. The experimental results demonstrate the superior effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed EI framework.},

In this paper, we propose 3D-OmniTrack, an approach that can accurately track the 3D location and orientation of an object. We introduce a polarization-sensitive phase model in an RFID system, which takes into consideration both the distance and the 3D posture of an object. Based on this model, we design an algorithm to accurately track the object in 3D space. We conduct real-world experiments and present results that show 3D-OmniTrack can achieve centimeter-level location accuracy with the average orientation error of 5{$^\circ$}. 3D-OmniTrack has significant advantages in both the accuracy and the efficiency, compared with state-of-the-art approaches.},

However, with the rapid development of wireless technology, large-scale communication networks with significant random interference have emerged, resulting in extremely high computational costs for capacity calculation. In ultra-dense wireless networks with extremely large numbers of base stations (BSs) and users, we provide fast estimation methods for determining the capacity. We consider two scenarios according to the ratio of the number of users to the number of BSs, {$\beta$}m. First, when {$\beta$}m {$\leq$} 1, the FIsher-Spiked Estimation (FISE) algorithm is proposed to determine the capacity by modeling the channel matrix with random interference as a Fisher matrix. Second, when {$\beta$}m {$>$} 1, based on a closed-form expression for capacity estimation requiring solely simple computations, we prove that this estimation stabilizes and remains invariant with increasing {$\beta$}m. Our methods can guarantee high accuracy on capacity estimation with low complexity, which is faster than the existing methods. Furthermore, our approaches exhibit excellent generality, free of network area shapes, BS and user distributions, and sub-network locations. Extensive simulation experiments across various scenarios demonstrate the high accuracy and robustness of our methods.},

We present P2LoRa, the first ambient LoRa backscatter system with parallel decoding and long-range communication. The high level idea of P2LoRa is to modulate data by shifting ambient LoRa packets with a small frequency. To achieve long distance communication, we enhance the SNR of the backscatter signal by concentrating leaked energy in both the frequency domain and time domain. We propose a method to accurately reconstruct and cancel the in-band excitation signal, which is orders of magnitude higher than the backscatter signal. For parallel decoding, we propose a method to cancel inter-tag interference with very low overhead and address the signal misalignment problem due to different time of flight. We prototype the P2LoRa tag with customized low-cost hardware and implement the P2LoRa gateway on USRP. Through extensive evaluations, we show that P2LoRa achieves a long communication distance of 2.2 km with ambient LoRa, and supports 101 parallel tag transmissions.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network (CNN)-based algorithm for solving ill-posed inverse problems. Regularized iterative algorithms have emerged as the standard approach to ill-posed inverse problems in the past few decades. These methods produce excellent results, but can be challenging to deploy in practice due to factors including the high computational cost of the forward and adjoint operators and the difficulty of hyperparameter selection. The starting point of this paper is the observation that unrolled iterative methods have the form of a CNN (filtering followed by pointwise nonlinearity) when the normal operator (H*H, where H* is the adjoint of the forward imaging operator, H) of the forward model is a convolution. Based on this observation, we propose using direct inversion followed by a CNN to solve normal-convolutional inverse problems. The direct inversion encapsulates the physical model of the system, but leads to artifacts when the problem is ill posed; the CNN combines multiresolution decomposition and residual learning in order to learn to remove these artifacts while preserving image structure. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed network in sparse-view reconstruction (down to 50 views) on parallel beam X-ray computed tomography in synthetic phantoms as well as in real experimental sinograms. The proposed network outperforms total variation-regularized iterative reconstruction for the more realistic phantoms and requires less than a second to reconstruct a 512 {\texttimes} 512 image on the GPU.},

  abstract = {Large-scale labeled data are generally required to train deep neural networks in order to obtain better performance in visual feature learning from images or videos for computer vision applications. To avoid extensive cost of collecting and annotating large-scale datasets, as a subset of unsupervised learning methods, self-supervised learning methods are proposed to learn general image and video features from large-scale unlabeled data without using any human-annotated labels. This paper provides an extensive review of deep learning-based self-supervised general visual feature learning methods from images or videos. First, the motivation, general pipeline, and terminologies of this field are described. Then the common deep neural network architectures that used for self-supervised learning are summarized. Next, the schema and evaluation metrics of self-supervised learning methods are reviewed followed by the commonly used image and video datasets and the existing self-supervised visual feature learning methods. Finally, quantitative performance comparisons of the reviewed methods on benchmark datasets are summarized and discussed for both image and video feature learning. At last, this paper is concluded and lists a set of promising future directions for self-supervised visual feature learning.},

  abstract = {We introduce RF-Wear, an accurate and wearable solution to track movements of a user's body using passive RFIDs embedded in their clothing. RF-Wear processes wireless signals reflected off these tags to a compact single-antenna RFID reader in the user's pocket. In doing so, RF-Wear enables a first-of-its-kind body-frame tracking mechanism that is lightweight and convenient for day-to-day use, without relying on external infrastructure. At the heart of RF-Wear is a novel primitive that computes angles between different parts of the user's body using the RFID tags attached to them. RF-Wear achieves this by treating groups of RFID tags as an array of antennas whose orientation can be computed accurately relative to the handheld reader. By computing the orientation of individual body parts, we demonstrate how RF-Wear reconstructs the real-time posture of the user's entire body frame. Our solution overcomes multiple challenges owing to the interactions of wireless signals with the body, the 3-D nature of human joints and the flexibility of fabric on which RFIDs are placed. We implement and evaluate a prototype of RF-Wear on commercial RFID readers and tags and demonstrate its performance in body-frame tracking. Our results reveal a mean error of 8--12{$^\circ$} in tracking angles at joints that rotate along one degree-of-freedom, and 21{$^\circ$}- azimuth, 8{$^\circ$}- elevation for joints supporting two degrees-of-freedom.},

In this work, we present NeuMAC, a unified approach that combines networking, architecture and AI to generate highly adaptive medium access protocols that can learn and optimize for the structure, correlations and statistics of the traffic patterns on the NoC. Our results show that NeuMAC can quickly adapt to NoC traffic to provide significant gains in terms of latency and overall execution time, improving the execution time by up to 1.69X - 3.74X.},

  abstract = {Much like earlier "network softwarization" efforts, the Open RAN concept is poised to have a transformative impact on the manner in which radio access networks (RANs) are realized and operated. The inherent complexity of the RAN ecosystem and the fact that it is rapidly evolving makes Open RAN a rich area of research into use cases, system realization, security, and more. This same complexity, however, hampers research efforts. Specifically, there is a lack of end-to-end open source software and fully-developed use cases associated with the Open RAN ecosystem. Further, to truly advance the state of the art will require use cases to be explored in realistic wireless environments. This paper describes our efforts to address these shortcomings by realizing NexRAN, a top-to-bottom, open-source Open RAN use case in the POWDER mobile and wireless research platform. Specifically, NexRAN allows closed-loop control of a RAN slicing realization in an O-RAN ecosystem. RAN slicing is implemented in the srsRAN open source mobility stack and is exposed through a custom service model to the NexRAN xApp, which executes on a RAN intelligent controller (RIC) from the O-RAN Alliance. The NexRAN xApp realizes policy driven closed-loop control of RAN slices by reading the current state of RAN elements (using the O-RAN key performance measurements (KPM) service model) and controlling slice behavior via the custom slicing service model. We demonstrate and evaluate NexRAN in the POWDER platform and have open sourced all aspects of our realization to enable research into this domain.},

We use a branch-and-cut approach via the maximum feasible subsystem problem to compute optimal solutions for small instances and investigate the uniqueness of the optimal solutions. We furthermore discuss six (modifications of) heuristics for this problem that appear in different parts of the literature. For small instances, the exact optimal solutions allow us to evaluate the quality of the heuristics, while for larger instances we compare their relative performance. One outcome is that the so-called basis pursuit heuristic performs worse, compared to the other methods. Among the best heuristics are a method due to Mangasarian and one due to Chinneck.},

Soil moisture sensing can be broken into two broad approaches, both of which have drawbacks. In situ sensors are installed in the ground, tend to be difficult to deploy and maintain, and have high costs. Remote-sensing based approaches use radars to infer soil moisture from surface reflection properties. While completely wireless, remote sensing suffers from lower resolution and accuracy compared to in situ sensing. We propose a hybrid approach that combines the advantages of both. This paper introduces the idea of using inexpensive in situ backscatter tags with above-ground radars, which enables completely wireless soil moisture measurements with high-accuracy and high-resolution. Our key idea is introducing a simple, power efficient modulation scheme that enables commodity radars to easily detect and range the underground tag. We have benchmarked our approach against oven-based, industry-standard ground-truth measurements and demonstrated that, at a realistic depth and across several types of soil, we achieve a 90th percentile error of 3.4\%, which is the same accuracy as state-of-the-art in situ sensors. We also demonstrate that our approach works with similar accuracy at a real farm.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the newly emerging wireless powered communication network in which one hybrid access point (H-AP) with constant power supply coordinates the wireless energy/information transmissions to/from a set of distributed users that do not have other energy sources. A "harvest-then-transmit" protocol is proposed where all users first harvest the wireless energy broadcast by the H-AP in the downlink (DL) and then send their independent information to the H-AP in the uplink (UL) by time-division-multiple-access (TDMA). First, we study the sum-throughput maximization of all users by jointly optimizing the time allocation for the DL wireless power transfer versus the users' UL information transmissions given a total time constraint based on the users' DL and UL channels as well as their average harvested energy values. By applying convex optimization techniques, we obtain the closed-form expressions for the optimal time allocations to maximize the sum-throughput. Our solution reveals an interesting "doubly near-far" phenomenon due to both the DL and UL distance-dependent signal attenuation, where a far user from the H-AP, which receives less wireless energy than a nearer user in the DL, has to transmit with more power in the UL for reliable information transmission. As a result, the maximum sum-throughput is shown to be achieved by allocating substantially more time to the near users than the far users, thus resulting in unfair rate allocation among different users. To overcome this problem, we furthermore propose a new performance metric so-called common-throughput with the additional constraint that all users should be allocated with an equal rate regardless of their distances to the H-AP. We present an efficient algorithm to solve the common-throughput maximization problem. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the common-throughput approach for solving the new doubly near-far problem in wireless powered communication networks.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we are interested in the 3D through-wall imaging of a completely unknown area, using WiFi RSSI and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) that move outside of the area of interest to collect WiFi measurements. It is challenging to estimate a volume represented by an extremely high number of voxels with a small number of measurements. Yet many applications are time-critical and/or limited on resources, precluding extensive measurement collection. In this paper, we then propose an approach based on Markov random field modeling, loopy belief propagation, and sparse signal processing for 3D imaging based on wireless power measurements. Furthermore, we show how to design emcient aerial routes that are informative for 3D imaging. Finally, we design and implement a complete experimental testbed and show high-quality 3D robotic through-wall imaging of unknown areas with less than 4\% of measurements.},

  abstract = {Despite great progress in simulating multiphysics problems using the numerical discretization of partial differential equations (PDEs), one still cannot seamlessly incorporate noisy data into existing algorithms, mesh generation remains complex, and high-d imensional problems governed by parameterized PDEs cannot be tackled. Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such networks can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the continuous space-t ime domain). Such physics-informed learning integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements them through neural networks or other kernel-b ased regression networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling high-d imensional problems.},

To address this, we design the first wide-area and scalable backscatter network with multiple receivers (RX) and transmitters (TX) base units to communicate with battery-free sensor nodes. Our system circumvents the inherent limitations of backscatter systems -including the limited coverage area, frequency-dependent operability, and sensor node limitations in handling network tasks- by introducing several coordination techniques between the base units starting from a single RX-TX pair to networks with many RX and TX units. We build low-cost RX and TX base units and battery-free sensor nodes with multiple sensing modalities and evaluate the performance of the MultiScatter system in various deployments. Our evaluation shows that we can successfully communicate with battery-free sensor nodes across 23400 ft2 of a two-floor educational complex using 5 RX and 20 TX units, costing \$569. Also, we show that the aggregated throughput of the backscatter network increases linearly as the number of RX units and the network coverage grows.},

However, backscatter links suffer from high loss due to two consecutive propagations and have to operate on narrow link-budget margins, which makes them more susceptible to multipath losses in indoor environments. To address this, we propose a closed-loop backscatter system that exploits diversity sources such as communication frequency and transceivers antennas based on the channel metrics to deliver reliable coverage over an entire area. We prototype a backscatter system with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transceivers and BLE compatible tags and deploy it in several multipath rich indoor environments. Our evaluations show that we can successfully communicate with a backscatter tag in a 50m2 indoor area. The proposed algorithm for selecting communication parameters achieves an average 2.7 x success rate compared to the random selection while satisfying FCC output power requirements for frequency hopping transceivers.},

These ensembles are used by a wide range of practitioners that include the scientific community, policymakers, and stakeholders from the public and private sectors. They also provide the scientific basis for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change-Assessment Reports. As its next phase now launches, the CMIP6-CORDEX datasets are expected to populate community repositories over the next couple of years, with updated state-of-the-art regional climate data that will further support national and regional communities and inform their climate adaptation and mitigation strategies. The protocol presented here focuses on the European domain (EURO-CORDEX). It takes the international CORDEX protocol covering all 14 global domains as its template. However, it expands on the international protocol in specific areas; incorporates historical and projected aerosol trends into the regional models in a consistent way with CMIP6 global climate models, to allow for a better comparison of global versus regional trends; produces more climate variables to better support sectorial climate impact assessments; and takes into account the recent scientific developments addressed in the CORDEX Flagship Pilot Studies, enabling a better assessment of processes and phenomena relevant to regional climate (e.g., land-use change, aerosol, convection, and urban environment). Here, we summarize the scientific analysis which led to the new simulation protocol and highlight the improvements we expect in the new generation regional climate ensemble.},

While near-ultrasound (with under 20 kHz frequency) communication has been developed for various applications recently, none of the previous work provides a perfect solution for 2nd screen services between TVs and smart devices. This is due mainly to the following real world challenges. The embedded signal in TV contents should be successfully received in a typical TV-watching environment by (i) delivering information at least at 15 bps with significantly low volume to avoid human perception, (ii) despite the presence of ambient noise, e.g., a tick, a snap, or a knock. To fulfill (i), we design chirp quaternary orthogonal keying (QOK) symbols. Especially, we aim to minimize inter-symbol interference (ISI) effects by symbol design in order to completely eliminate guard intervals. To resolve (ii), we propose the novel J-shape detection algorithms for both frame synchronization and carrier sensing. The proposed modem achieves almost zero frame error rate on a smartphone 2.7 m away from the TV even with minimal receive sound pressure level of 35 dBSPL, i.e., the noise level in a very quiet room. Moreover, throughout experiments and log analysis of 2nd screen service deployed in a nation-wide TV broadcasting system, J-shape detection algorithms are proven to achieve highly resilient performance for both frame synchronization and carrier sensing compared to previous schemes.},

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to locate spectrum offenders using crowdsourcing. In such a participatory sensing system, privacy and bandwidth concerns preclude distributed sensing devices from reporting raw signal samples to a central agency; instead, devices would be limited to measurements of received power. However, this limitation enables a smart attacker to evade localization by simultaneously transmitting from multiple infected devices. Existing localization methods are insufficient or incapable of locating multiple sources when the powers from each source cannot be separated at the receivers. In this paper, we first propose a simple and efficient method that simultaneously locates multiple transmitters using the received power measurements from the selected devices. Second, we build sampling approaches to select sensing devices required for localization. Next, we enhance our sampling to also take into account incentives for participation in crowdsourcing. We experimentally evaluate our localization framework under a variety of settings and find that we are able to localize multiple sources transmitting simultaneously with reasonably high accuracy in a timely manner.},

In this work, a simple, low cost and accurate microwave reflection type system for detection of water in fuel tanks has been developed. A module consisting of a microwave generator and a detecting diode is used to measure the microwave reflection coefficient at various positions through the fuel tank. In the course of the study, a motion control and data acquisition system has been developed. Software written using the LabVIEW programming language is used to control the movement of the sensor and for the data acquisition. Theoretical and experimental results show the ability of the system to detect the presence of a water level down to approximately 1 mm. A simple theoretical model for power prediction of the reflected signal at various positions of the sensor in the tank is also presented.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the joint resource allocation and trajectory design for a multi-user, multi-target unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where the link capacity between a ground base station (BS) and the UAV is limited. The UAV conducts target sensing and information transmission in orthogonal time slots to prevent interference. As is common in practical systems, sensing is performed while the UAV hovers, allowing the UAV to acquire high-quality sensing data. Subsequently, the acquired sensing data is offloaded to the ground BS for further processing. We jointly optimize the UAV trajectory, UAV velocity, beamforming for the communication users, power allocated to the sensing beam, and time of hovering for sensing to minimize the power consumption of the UAV while ensuring the communication quality of service (QoS) and successful sensing. Due to the prohibitively high complexity of the resulting nonconvex mixed integer non-linear program (MINLP), we employ a series of transformations and optimization techniques, including semidefinite relaxation, big-M method, penalty approach, and successive convex approximation, to obtain a low-complexity suboptimal solution. Our simulation results reveal that 1) the proposed design achieves significant power savings compared to two baseline schemes; 2) stricter sensing requirements lead to longer sensing times, highlighting the challenge of efficiently managing both sensing accuracy and sensing time; 3) the optimized trajectory design ensures precise hovering directly above the targets during sensing, enhancing sensing quality and enabling the application of energy-focused beams; and 4) the proposed trajectory design balances the capacity of the backhaul link and the downlink rate of the communication users.},

Consequently, top-down methods have difficulties in recovering accurate 3D human meshes under severe person-person occlusion. To address this, we present Occluded Human Mesh Recovery (OCHMR) - a novel top-down mesh recovery approach that incorporates image spatial context to overcome the limitations of the single-human assumption. The approach is conceptually simple and can be applied to any existing top-down architecture. Along with the input image, we condition the top-down model on spatial context from the image in the form of body-center heatmaps. To reason from the predicted body centermaps, we introduce Contextual Normalization (CoNorm) blocks to adaptively modulate intermediate features of the top-down model. The contextual conditioning helps our model disambiguate between two severely overlapping human boundingboxes, making it robust to multi-person occlusion. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, OCHMR achieves superior performance on challenging multi-person benchmarks like 3DPW, CrowdPose and OCHuman. Specifically, our proposed contextual reasoning architecture applied to the SPIN model with ResNet-50 backbone results in 75.2 PMPJPE on 3DPW-PC, 23.6 AP on CrowdPose and 37.7 AP on OCHu- man datasets, a significant improvement of 6.9 mm, 6.4 AP and 20.8 AP respectively over the baseline.},

IEEE 802.11ax was launched in May 2014 with the goal of enhancing throughput-per-area in high-density scenarios. The first 802.11ax draft versions, namely, D1.0 and D2.0, were released at the end of 2016 and 2017. Focusing on a more mature version D3.0, in this tutorial paper, we help the reader to smoothly enter into the several major 802.11ax breakthroughs, including a brand new orthogonal frequency-division multiple access-based random access approach as well as novel spatial frequency reuse techniques. In addition, this tutorial will highlight selected significant improvements (including physical layer enhancements, multi-user multiple input multiple output extensions, power saving advances, and so on) which make this standard a very significant step forward with respect to its predecessor 802.11ac.},

  abstract = {Variational autoencoder (VAE) is a very successful generative model whose key element is the so-called amortized inference network, which can perform test time inference using a single feed forward pass. Unfortunately, this comes at the cost of degraded accuracy in posterior approximation, often underperforming the instance-wise variational optimization. Although the latest semi-amortized approaches mitigate the issue by performing a few variational optimization updates starting from the VAE's amortized inference output, they inherently suffer from computational overhead for inference at test time. In this paper, we address the problem in a completely different way by considering a random inference model, where we model the mean and variance functions of the variational posterior as random Gaussian processes (GP). The motivation is that the deviation of the VAE's amortized posterior distribution from the true posterior can be regarded as random noise, which allows us to view the approximation error as uncertainty in posterior approximation that can be dealt with in a principled GP manner. In particular, our model can quantify the difficulty in posterior approximation by a Gaussian variational density. Inference in our GP model is done by a single feed forward pass through the network, significantly faster than semi-amortized methods. We show that our approach attains higher test data likelihood than the state-ofthe-arts on several benchmark datasets.},

NR-Surface incorporates (i) a new extremely low-power (14KHz sampling) reconfiguration interface, NarrowBand Packet Unit (NBPU), for synchronization and real-time reconfiguration, and (ii) a highly responsive and low-leakage metasurface designed for low-duty cycled operation, by carefully leveraging the structure and the periodicity of the NR beam management procedure in the NR standard. NR-Surface is prototyped and evaluated end-to-end with NR BS built on srsRAN to demonstrate diverse usage scenarios including multiple NR-Surface per BS, multiple UE per NR-Surface, and 3D beamforming.

Our key idea is to create unique asymmetric THz fingerprints in 3D so that a wireless node can jointly infer its angular position and distance by taking hints from the measured power-spectrum profile. We introduce a dual-polarized dual-slit waveguide structure that emits out signals into free-space with a key feature that the beam pattern depends on the frequency of the signal and the geometry of the slit. To distinguish the emissions from the two slits, we use polarization diversity and manipulate the aperture geometry of the two slits so that they transmit slightly different angular-spectral signatures. Our over-the-air experiments demonstrate that 123-LOC achieves an average angle estimation error of 1{\textopenbullet} together with millimeter-scale ranging resolution, solely through non-coherent power measurements.},

It can access RAN and application-level information to execute AIoptimized and other policies in real-time (sub-millisecond). We demonstrate that EdgeRIC operates as if embedded within the RAN stack.

The RISs have been under intense investigation lately for their ability to provide control on the mmWave sparse channels. This has been shown to improve the coverage and signal power levels in environments where line-of-sight (LoS) paths cannot be guaranteed. The gain properties of RISs in LoS channels are analyzed with respect to carrier frequency and the size of the RIS. It is shown that the RISs provide the best gain compared to LoS links at lower frequencies due to the larger RIS sizes for a fixed number of antenna elements. On the other hand, high gain RISs tend to push the near field far away from the array in the low frequencies. These observations mean that different parts of the mmWave band have advantages and disadvantages when utilizing RIS assisted channels.},

In order to solve this problem, we propose a novel multi-dimensional framework, spanning time, frequency, and space domains, that can separate the signal reflected from each walking person and extract its corresponding gait content, in order to identify multiple people through walls. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that WiFi signals can identify multiple people in an area. We extensively validate our proposed system with 92 test experiments conducted in 4 different areas, where the WiFi transceivers are placed behind walls, and where 2 or 3 people (randomly selected from a pool of 6 test subjects) are walking in the area. Our system achieves an overall average accuracy of 82\% in correctly identifying whether a person walking in the test experiment (referred to as a query) is the same as a candidate person, based on 6,404 query-candidate test pairs. It is noteworthy that none of the test subjects/areas has been seen in the training phase.},

SpotFi makes two key technical contributions. First, SpotFi incorporates super-resolution algorithms that can accurately compute the angle of arrival (AoA) of multipath components even when the access point (AP) has only three antennas. Second, it incorporates novel filtering and estimation techniques to identify AoA of direct path between the localization target and AP by assigning values for each path depending on how likely the particular path is the direct path. Our experiments in a multipath rich indoor environment show that SpotFi achieves a median accuracy of 40 cm and is robust to indoor hindrances such as obstacles and multipath.},

  abstract = {A compact dyadic diffraction coefficient for electromagnetic waves obliquely incident on a curved edse formed by perfectly conducting curved ot plane surfaces is obtained. This diffraction coefficient remains valid in the transition regions adjacent to shadow and reflection boundaries, where the diffraction coefficients of Keller's original theory fail. Our method is based on Keller's method of the canonical problem, which in this case is the perfectly conducting wedge illuminated by plane, cylindrical, conical, and spherical waves. When the proper ray-fixed coordinate system is introduced, the dyadic diffraction coefficient for the wedge is found to be the sum of only two dyads, and it is shown that this is also true for the dyadic diffraction coefficients of higher order edges. One dyad contains the acoustic soft diffraction coefficient; the other dyad contains the acoustic hard diffraction coefficient. The expressions for the acoustic wedge diffraction coefficients contain Fresenel integrals, which ensure that the total field is continuous at shadow and reflection boundaries. The diffraction coefficients have the same form for the different types of edge illumination; only the arguments of the Fresnel integrals are different. Since diffraction is a local phenomenon, and locally the curved edge structure is wedge shaped, this result is readily extended to the curved wedge. It is interesting that even though the polarizations and the wavefront curvatures of the incident, reflected, and diffracted waves are markedly different, the total field calculated from this high-frequency solution for the curved wedge is continuous at shadow and reflection boundaries.},

  abstract = {This report deals with the use of points as surface rendering and modeling primitives. The main components of point-based rendering and modeling algorithms are identified, different approaches are discussed and compared. The weaknesses of current point-based techniques are pointed out and for some of them a possible solution is suggested. A new algorithm for depth-of-field rendering based on surface splatting is presented. It features rendering time independent of the amount of depth-blur and depth-of-field rendering in scenes with semi-transparent surfaces. For this algorithm a mathematical analysis, an implementation and a discussion of results are given.},

We prove convergence to a minimizer for dimension 1, and various limited convergence results for dimension 2. A counterexample of McKinnon gives a family of strictly convex functions in two dimensions and a set of initial conditions for which the Nelder--Mead algorithm converges to a nonminimizer. It is not yet known whether the Nelder--Mead method can be proved to converge to a minimizer for a more specialized class of convex functions in two dimensions.},

  abstract = {Radio frequency identification (RFID) and wireless sensors networks (WSNs) are two fundamental pillars that enable the Internet of Things (IoT). RFID systems are able to identify and track devices, whilst WSNs cooperate to gather and provide information from interconnected sensors. This involves challenges, for example, in transforming RFID systems with identification capabilities into sensing and computational platforms, as well as considering them as architectures of wirelessly connected sensing tags. This, together with the latest advances in WSNs and with the integration of both technologies, has resulted in the opportunity to develop novel IoT applications. This paper presents a review of these two technologies and the obstacles and challenges that need to be overcome. Some of these challenges are the efficiency of the energy harvesting, communication interference, fault tolerance, higher capacities to handling data processing, cost feasibility, and an appropriate integration of these factors. Additionally, two emerging trends in IoT are reviewed: the combination of RFID and WSNs in order to exploit their advantages and complement their limitations, and wearable sensors, which enable new promising IoT applications.},

  abstract = {Deep learning revolutionized data science, and recently its popularity has grown exponentially, as did the amount of papers employing deep networks. Vision tasks, such as human pose estimation, did not escape from this trend. There is a large number of deep models, where small changes in the network architecture, or in the data pre-processing, together with the stochastic nature of the optimization procedures, produce notably different results, making extremely difficult to sift methods that significantly outperform others. This situation motivates the current study, in which we perform a systematic evaluation and statistical analysis of vanilla deep regression, i.e., convolutional neural networks with a linear regression top layer. This is the first comprehensive analysis of deep regression techniques. We perform experiments on four vision problems, and report confidence intervals for the median performance as well as the statistical significance of the results, if any. Surprisingly, the variability due to different data pre-processing procedures generally eclipses the variability due to modifications in the network architecture. Our results reinforce the hypothesis according to which, in general, a general-purpose network (e.g., VGG-16 or ResNet-50) adequately tuned can yield results close to the state-of-the-art without having to resort to more complex and ad-hoc regression models.},

  abstract = {An analytical solution for the bistatic electromagnetic (EM) scattering from an acoustically excited vibrating dielectric circular cylinder is presented. The incident acoustic wave causes a boundary deformation as well as a dielectric inhomogeneity within the dielectric cylinder. First, a perturbation method is developed to calculate the EM scattering from a slightly deformed and inhomogeneous dielectric cylinder. Then, assuming the vibration frequency is much smaller than the frequency of the incident EM wave, a closed form expression for the time-frequency response of the bistatic scattered field is obtained. The solution for acoustic scattering from an elastic cylinder is applied to give the displacement on the surface as well as the compression and dilation within the cylinder. Both the surface displacement and the variation in material density (dielectric constant fluctuation) within the cylinder contribute to the Doppler component of the EM scattered field. Results indicate that the Doppler frequencies correspond to the mechanical vibration frequencies of the cylinder and that the Doppler components only become sizeable near frequencies corresponding to the natural modes of free vibration in the cylinder. These resonances depend only on the object properties and are independent of the surrounding medium. Thus, utilizing the information in the Doppler spectrum scattered by an acoustically excited object vibrating at resonance could provide a means for buried object identification.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to find an optimal matching between manifold-valued curves, and thereby adequately compare their shapes, seen as equivalent classes with respect to the action of reparameterization. Using a canonical decomposition of a path in a principal bundle, we introduce a simple algorithm that finds an optimal matching between two curves by computing the geodesic of the infinite-dimensional manifold of curves that is at all time horizontal to the fibers of the shape bundle. We focus on the elastic metric studied in Le Brigant (J Geom Mech 9(2):131--156, 2017) using the so-called square root velocity framework. The quotient structure of the shape bundle is examined, and in particular horizontality with respect to the fibers. These results are more generally given for any elastic metric. We then introduce a comprehensive discrete framework which correctly approximates the smooth setting when the base manifold has constant sectional curvature. It is itself a Riemannian structure on the product manifold \$\$M{\textasciicircum}\{n\}\$\$ M n of ``discrete curves'' given by n points, and we show its convergence to the continuous model as the size n of the discretization goes to \$\${\textbackslash}infty \$\$ {$\infty$} . Illustrations of geodesics and optimal matchings between discrete curves are given in the hyperbolic plane, the plane and the sphere, for synthetic and real data, and comparison with dynamic programming (Srivastava and Klassen in Functional and shape data analysis, Springer, Berlin, 2016) is established.},

  abstract = {Each fall, millions of monarch butterflies across the northern US and Canada migrate up to 4,000 km to overwinter in the exact same cluster of mountain peaks in central Mexico. To track monarchs precisely and study their navigation, a monarch tracker must obtain daily localization of the butterfly as it progresses on its 3-month journey. And, the tracker must perform this task while having a weight in the tens of milligram (mg) and measuring a few millimeters (mm) in size to avoid interfering with monarch's flight. This paper proposes mSAIL, 8 {\texttimes} 8 {\texttimes} 2.6 mm and 62 mg embedded system for monarch migration tracking, constructed using 8 prior customdesigned ICs providing solar energy harvesting, an ultra-low power processor, light/temperature sensors, power management, and a wireless transceiver, all integrated and 3D stacked on a micro PCB with an 8 {\texttimes} 8 mm printed antenna. The proposed system is designed to record and compress light and temperature data during the migration path while harvesting solar energy for energy autonomy, and wirelessly transmit the data at the overwintering site in Mexico, from which the daily location of the butterfly can be estimated using a deep learning-based localization algorithm. A 2-day trial experiment of mSAIL attached on a live butterfly in an outdoor botanical garden demonstrates the feasibility of individual butterfly localization and tracking.},

Each of the cylinders can have an arbitrary number of stratified layers, and the incident wave is plane-polarized with either the magnetic or the electric field vector perpendicular to the axes of the cylinders. The scattered wave coefficients are obtained for a rigorous solution of Maxwell's equations by accounting for the dependent scattering effects, which include multiple scattering in the near field and wave interference in the far field. Expressions are derived for the far-field radiative properties, which include the extinction and scattering cross sections, as well as the intensity functions. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the influence of spacing and incident angle on the radiative properties of a pair of silicon-coated silica cylinders. These results reveal that the extinction and scattering cross sections based on independent scattering theory are considerably different from those based on our dependent scattering formulation. The present formulation provides the theoretical basis for the analysis of high-density fiber matrix composites containing coated fibers.},

  abstract = {Radar, as one of the sensors for human activity recognition (HAR), has unique characteristics such as privacy protection and contactless sensing. Radar-based HAR has been applied in many fields such as human--computer interaction, smart surveillance and health assessment. Conventional machine learning approaches rely on heuristic hand-crafted feature extraction, and their generalization capability is limited. Additionally, extracting features manually is time--consuming and inefficient. Deep learning acts as a hierarchical approach to learn high-level features automatically and has achieved superior performance for HAR. This paper surveys deep learning based HAR in radar from three aspects: deep learning techniques, radar systems, and deep learning for radar-based HAR. Especially, we elaborate deep learning approaches designed for activity recognition in radar according to the dimension of radar returns (i.e., 1D, 2D and 3D echoes). Due to the difference of echo forms, corresponding deep learning approaches are different to fully exploit motion information. Experimental results have demonstrated the feasibility of applying deep learning for radar-based HAR in 1D, 2D and 3D echoes. Finally, we address some current research considerations and future opportunities.},

However, 4G/5G mobility management is not always reliable in extreme mobility, with non-negligible failures and policy con{\dbend}icts. The root cause is that, existing mobility management is primarily based on wireless signal strength. While reasonable in static and low mobility, it is vulnerable to dramatic wireless dynamics from extreme mobility in triggering, decision, and execution. We devise REM, Reliable Extreme Mobility management for 4G, 5G, and beyond. REM shifts to movement-based mobility management in the delayDoppler domain. Its signaling overlay relaxes feedback via crossband estimation, simpli{\dbend}es policies with provable con{\dbend}ict freedom, and stabilizes signaling via scheduling-based OTFS modulation. Our evaluation with operational high-speed rail datasets shows that, REM reduces failures comparable to static and low mobility, with low signaling and latency cost.},

However, the existing ellipse algorithm is likely to result in a considerable measuring error, because the algorithm simply treats the time corresponding to the vertical axis of the ellipse extracted from the echo signal as the TOF. To improve the measuring accuracy of the TOF, we propose a modified TOF measurement method based on the existing ellipse algorithm, where the Canny operator for edge detection in 2-D image processing is used. first, the ellipse algorithm is utilized to extract the echo pulse from the ultrasonic echo signal, from which a 2-D pulse pattern approximating an elliptical shape is obtained. Then, the Canny operator is applied to detect the boundary of the extracted elliptic pulse. Finally, the maximum gradients of the ellipse edge variation in the second and third quadrants of the coordinate system are calculated, and the TOF can be determined by averaging two time points corresponding to two maximum gradients of the edge change in two quadrants. The relevant experiments demonstrate that the modified method can obtain a more accurate TOF with approximately 30\% error reduction.},

  abstract = {Contact-less liquid identification via wireless sensing has diverse potential applications in our daily life, such as identifying alcohol content in liquids, distinguishing spoiled and fresh milk, and even detecting water contamination. Recent works have verified the feasibility of utilizing mmWave radar to perform coarse-grained material identification, e.g., discriminating liquid and carpet. However, they do not fully exploit the sensing limits of mmWave in terms of fine-grained material classification. In this paper, we propose FG-LiquID, an accurate and robust system for fine-grained liquid identification. To achieve the desired fine granularity, FG-LiquID first focuses on the small but informative region of the mmWave spectrum, so as to extract the most discriminative features of liquids. Then we design a novel neural network, which uncovers and leverages the hidden signal patterns across multiple antennas on mmWave sensors. In this way, FG-LiquID learns to calibrate signals and finally eliminate the adverse effect of location interference caused by minor displacement/rotation of the liquid container, which ensures robust identification towards daily usage scenarios. Extensive experimental results using a custom-build prototype demonstrate that FG-LiquID can accurately distinguish 30 different liquids with an average accuracy of 97\%, under 5 different scenarios. More importantly, it can discriminate quite similar liquids, such as liquors with the difference of only 1\% alcohol concentration by volume.},

Although existing methods aim to achieve fine-grained identification, i.e., distinguishing a 1\% v/v difference in alcohol content, they still have limitations in detecting highly deceptive counterfeit liquors that have much smaller content differences, sometimes as low as 0.2\% v/v alcohol content. In this paper, we propose mmTaster, a mobile system that combines the mmWave radar with a smartphone to perform fine-grained and robust alcohol sensing. To achieve the desired fine granularity, we introduce a novel feature extraction model that exploits the unique reflection responses across multiple mmWave frequencies, which provide discriminative information about liquid content. Furthermore, we observe the serious interference of target displacement on identification performance, which hinders the various applications in mobile scenarios. To enhance the robustness, mmTaster incorporates a customized translation-invariant neural network, ConvNet, to remove the location interference and extract stable liquid-dependent features regardless of target displacement. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that mmTaster can accurately distinguish the alcohol differences as low as 0.2\% v/v with an accuracy of over 90.8\% even in scenarios involving diverse displacements and rotations.},

A practical and deployable RFID localization system needs to meet reliability, throughput, and range requirements. This paper presents RF-CHORD, the first RFID localization system that simultaneously meets all three requirements. RF-CHORD features a multisine-constructed wideband design that can process RF signals with a 200 MHz bandwidth in real-time to facilitate one-shot localization at scale. In addition, multiple SINR enhancement techniques are designed for range extension. On top of that, a kernel-layer near-field localization framework and a multipath-suppression algorithm are proposed to reduce the 99th long-tail errors. Our empirical results show that RF-CHORD can localize up to 180 tags 6 m away from a reader within 1 second and with 99th longtail error of 0.786 m, achieving a 0\% miss reading rate and {\textasciitilde}0.01\% cross-reading rate in the warehouse and fresh food delivery store deployment.},

  abstract = {LoRaWAN has emerged as an appealing technology to connect IoT devices but it functions without explicit coordination among transmitters, which can lead to many packet collisions as the network scales. State-of-the-art work proposes various approaches to deal with these collisions, but most functions only in high signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) conditions and thus does not scale to many scenarios where weak receptions are easily buried by stronger receptions from nearby transmitters. In this paper, we take a fresh look at LoRa's physical layer, revealing that its underlying linear chirp modulation fundamentally limits the capacity and scalability of concurrentLoRa transmissions. We show that by replacing linear chirps with their non-linear counterparts, we can boost the capacity of concurrent LoRa transmissions and empower the LoRa receiver to successfully receive weak transmissions in the presence of strong colliding signals. Such a non-linear chirp design further enables the receiver to demodulate fully aligned collision symbols - a case where none of the existing approaches can deal with. We implement these ideas in a holistic LoRaWAN stack based on the USRP N210 software-defined radio platform. Our head-to-head comparison with two state-of-the-art research systems and a standard LoRaWAN baseline demonstrates that CurvingLoRa improves the network throughput by 1.6-7.6x while simultaneously sacrificing neither power efficiency nor noise resilience. An open-source dataset and code will be made available before publication.},

Contact lens-based IOP sensing has garnered significant attention in research. Existing research has been focusing on developing the sensor itself, so the techniques used to read sensing data only support a reading range of several centimeters, becoming the main obstacle for real-world deployment. This paper presents Cyclops, the first battery-free IOP sensing system integrated into a contact lens, which overcomes the proximity constraints of traditional reading methods. Cyclops features a three-layer antenna comprising two metallic layers and a nanomaterial-based sensing layer in between. This innovative antenna serves a dual purpose, functioning as both a pressure sensor and a communication antenna simultaneously. The antenna is connected to an RFID chip, which utilizes a lowpower self-tuning circuit to achieve high-precision pressure sensing, akin to a 9-bit ADC. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Cyclops supports communication at meterlevel distances, and its IOP measurement accuracy surpasses that of commercial portable IOP measurement devices.},

  abstract = {A joint design approach is proposed for the coexistence of MIMO radars and a communication system, for a scenario in which the targets fall in different range bins. Radar transmit precoding and adaptive communication transmission are adopted, and are jointly designed to maximize signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) at the radar receiver subject to the communication system meeting certain rate and power constraints. We start with the design of a system in which knowledge of the target information is used. Such design can be used to benchmark the performance of schemes that do not use target information. Then, we propose a design which does not require target information. In both cases, the optimization problems are nonconvex with respect to the design variables and have high computational complexity. Alternating optimization and sequential convex programming techniques are used to find a local maximum. Based on the analysis of the obtained solution, we propose a reduced dimensionality design, which has reduced complexity without degrading the radar SINR. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed spectrum sharing framework.},

Automating the process of action recognition from visual data has been the topic of much research in the computer vision community. But what if it is too dark, or if the person is occluded or behind a wall? In this paper, we introduce a neural network model that can detect human actions through walls and occlusions, and in poor lighting conditions. Our model takes radio frequency (RF) signals as input, generates 3D human skeletons as an intermediate representation, and recognizes actions and interactions of multiple people over time. By translating the input to an intermediate skeleton-based representation, our model can learn from both vision-based and RF-based datasets, and allow the two tasks to help each other. We show that our model achieves comparable accuracy to vision-based action recognition systems in visible scenarios, yet continues to work accurately when people are not visible, hence addressing scenarios that are beyond the limit of today's vision-based action recognition.},

  abstract = {Within the mm-Wave range of the B5G communication systems, there will appear many types of applications with different link types. In discussions on how to cover the various channel modeling requirements of such applications, some researchers have suggested map-based channel models that are based on a ray-tracing algorithm. This article thus begins with an overview of mapbased mm-Wave channel models. The overview includes available modeling requirements with map-based channel models and the categorization of map-based channel parameters. We then explain why map-based channel models are necessary for researchers trying to evaluate novel technologies in the mm-Wave range. They are particularly necessary when the technologies operate with a new link type or when channel behaviors of a user exhibit user-specific characteristics. Next, we share the measurement data and the map-based channel parameters, which can model new link types and have user-specific characteristics. Finally, as a use case of the proposed channel model, we evaluate a machine-learning-based beam-selection algorithm that exploits power delay profiles through the shared database and a geometry-based stochastic channel model (GSCM). The delay profiles of the shared database are user-specific so they are highly correlated with angular parameters. Numerical results show that the algorithm can be more accurately evaluated through the shared database than through a GSCM. We expect that our overview and sharing the database will enable researchers to readily design a map-based channel model and evaluate B5G and machine-learning technologies.},

Hence, by doing so, the data can be recollected and can be stored for future purposes. The type of data can be in the form of structure or unstructured points.

We prototype Shrimp on commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) LEDs with fabricated printed circuit boards (PCBs). Extensive experiments conducted in an indoor water pool, a lake, and the sea demonstrate that Shrimp can combat against environmental interference and achieve robust communication in underwater environments.

  abstract = {Intelligent vision control systems for surgical robots should adapt to unknown and diverse objects while being robust to system disturbances. Previous methods did not meet these requirements due to mainly relying on pose estimation and feature tracking. We propose a world-model-based deep reinforcement learning framework ``Grasp Anything for Surgery'' (GAS), that learns a pixel-level visuomotor policy for surgical grasping, enhancing both generality and robustness. In particular, a novel method is proposed to estimate the values and uncertainties of depth pixels for a rigid-link object's inaccurate region based on the empirical prior of the object's size; both depth and mask images of task objects are encoded to a single compact 3-channel image (size: 64x64x3) by dynamically zooming in the mask regions, minimizing the information loss. The learned controller's effectiveness is extensively evaluated in simulation and in a real robot. Our learned visuomotor policy handles: i) unseen objects, including 5 types of target grasping objects and a robot gripper, in unstructured real-world surgery environments, and ii) disturbances in perception and control. Note that we are the first work to achieve a unified surgical control system that grasps diverse surgical objects using different robot grippers on real robots in complex surgery scenes (average success rate: 69\%). Our system also demonstrates significant robustness across 6 conditions including background variation, target disturbance, camera pose variation, kinematic control error, image noise, and re-grasping after the gripped target object drops from the gripper. Videos and codes can be found on our project page: https://linhongbin.github.io/gas/.},

Most existing VLP approaches require special designed light or receiver, collecting light information or strict user operation (e.g., horizontally holding mobile phone). This incurs a high deployment, maintenance and usage overhead. We present RainbowLight, a low cost ambient light 3D localization approach easy to deploy in today's buildings. Our key finding is that light through a chip of polarizer and birefringence material produces specific interference and light spectrum at different directions to the chip. We derive a model to characterize the relation for direction, light interference and spectrum. Exploiting the model, RainbowLight calculates the direction to a chip after taking a photo containing the chip. With multiple chips, RainbowLight designs a direction intersection based method to derive the location. We implement RainbowLight and extensively evaluate its performance in various environments. The evaluation results show that RainbowLight achieves an average localization error of 3.3 cm in 2D and 9.6 cm in 3D for light on, and an error of 7.4 cm in 2D and 20.5 cm in 3D for light off scenario in daytime.},

The range-based methods obtain the distance or angle between the antenna and tag utilizing the received signal strength indicator (RSSI), time information or signal phase and estimate tag location further combining the scheme geometrical characteristics. The methods based on fingerprinting and non-fingerprinting are mainly discussed in the range-free domain.

We then propose minimizing the CRB of radar sensing while guaranteeing a pre-defined level of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for each communication user. For the single-user scenario, we derive a closed form for the optimal solution for both cases of point and extended targets. For the multi-user scenario, we show that both problems can be relaxed into semidefinite programming by using the semidefinite relaxation approach, and prove that the global optimum can be generally obtained. Finally, we demonstrate numerically that the globally optimal solutions are reachable via the proposed methods, which provide significant gains in target estimation performance over state-of-the-art benchmarks.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Life and civilization in arid regions depend on the availability of freshwater. Arid alpine river basins, where hydrological processes are highly sensitive to rapid warming, act as vital water towers for lowland oases. However, scientific understanding of precipitation variability and related cryosphere--hydrology processes is extremely limited because of the scarcity of in situ observations. The upper Danghe River basin (UDB; {$\sim$}14,000 km               2               ) is an arid and westerly dominated basin on the northeastern Tibetan Plateau and is the water source for the Dunhuang Oasis in China. We have established a comprehensive cryosphere--hydrometeorology observation network in the basin since 2014. At present, the network consists of 21 automatic rain gauges, 22 soil freeze--thaw monitoring stations, 4 automatic weather stations (AWS), and a 50-m gradient meteorological tower with an eddy covariance system. In particular, the 18 sites, located in remote areas without public networks, are equipped with new-generation BeiDou-3 communication terminals that enable the observations to be easily, safely, and reliably read and quality controlled in near--real time from offices in the city or at home. This integrated observation network over the UDB that facilitates the monitoring of cryosphere--hydrology processes, land--atmosphere interactions, and local weather processes. In addition, the observations are helpful for the objective evaluation, and continual improvement, of hydrological models, satellite-retrieval products, and reanalysis datasets. Finally, the network is expected to promote a better understanding of the status and role of water towers in arid zones and to provide basic data support for the sustainable development of the Dunhuang Oasis and the Belt and Road.},

  abstract = {Lip language recognition urgently needs wearable and easy-to-use interfaces for interference-free and high-fidelity lip-reading acquisition and to develop accompanying data-efficient decoder-modeling methods. Existing solutions suffer from unreliable lip reading, are data hungry, and exhibit poor generalization. Here, we propose a wearable lip language decoding technology that enables interference-free and high-fidelity acquisition of lip movements and data-efficient recognition of fluent lip language based on wearable motion capture and continuous lip speech movement reconstruction. The method allows us to artificially generate any wanted continuous speech datasets from a very limited corpus of word samples from users. By using these artificial datasets to train the decoder, we achieve an average accuracy of 92.0\% across individuals (               n               = 7) for actual continuous and fluent lip speech recognition for 93 English sentences, even observing no training burn on users because all training datasets are artificially generated. Our method greatly minimizes users' training/learning load and presents a data-efficient and easy-to-use paradigm for lip language recognition.                        ,              A data-efficient method of fluent lip speech recognition is based on wearable motion capture and speech movement reconstruction.},

However, the current hop-by-hop stateful cellular session impedes this effort due to its need for tight functional coupling and stable service relationships among satellite operators, mobile operators, and users. Our empirical study with real satellite data shows that, it restricts LEO satellites' serviceable areas, limits the use of available (possibly competitive) satellites, and suffers from signaling storms and dynamic many-to-many relationships in extreme LEO mobility. We thus devise MOSAIC to strive for self-serve multi-tenant LEO satellites. MOSAIC defines policy-embedded one-time tokens for pay-as-you-go local satellite access. These tokens allow satellites to self-serve users anywhere without relying on remote mobile operators, alleviate inter-satellite coordinations to enjoy competitive satellites, and simplify many-to-many service relationships for on-demand multi-tenancy. MOSAIC is attack-resilient and incrementally deployable using our SIM-based solution. Our evaluations with the real satellite data and commodity 3GPP NTN protocol stack validate MOSAIC's viability.},

We propose a simple yet effective signal model, in which the received signal is separated into static and dynamic components. We establish the relationship between measured signal changes and sediment concentration via polynomial fitting in offline step. Therefore, the sediment concentration can be accurately detected with a simple mapping operation in the following online step. We implement a prototype system with COTS RFID devices, and extensive experiments are conducted to validate our design. The experimental results demonstrate that our scheme is able to achieve more than 95\% accuracy for sediment concentration detection in water.},

  abstract = {Future Internet-of-Things (IoT) is expected to wirelessly connect billions of low-complexity devices. For wireless information transfer (IT) in IoT, high density of IoT devices and their ad hoc communication result in strong interference, which acts as a bottleneck on wireless IT. Furthermore, battery replacement for the massive number of IoT devices is difficult if not infeasible, making wireless energy transfer (ET) desirable. This motivates: 1) the design of full-duplex wireless IT to reduce latency and enable efficient spectrum utilization and 2) the implementation of passive IoT devices using backscatter antennas that enable wireless ET from one device (reader) to another (tag). However, the resultant increase in the density of simultaneous links exacerbates the interference issue. This issue is addressed in this paper by proposing the design of full-duplex backscatter communication (BackCom) networks, where a novel multiple-access scheme based on time-hopping spread-spectrum is designed to enable both one-way wireless ET and two-way wireless IT in coexisting backscatter reader-tag links. Comprehensive performance analysis of BackCom networks is presented in this paper, including forward/backward bit-error rates and wireless ET efficiency and outage probabilities, which accounts for energy harvesting at tags, non-coherent and coherent detection at tags and readers, respectively, and the effects of asynchronous transmissions.},

We commence by discussing the interplay between sensing and communications (S\&C) from a historical point of view, and then consider the multiple facets of ISAC and the resulting performance gains. By introducing both ongoing and potential use cases, we shed light on the industrial progress and standardization activities related to ISAC. We analyze a number of performance tradeoffs between S\&C, spanning from information theoretical limits to physical layer performance tradeoffs, and the cross-layer design tradeoffs. Next, we discuss the signal processing aspects of ISAC, namely ISAC waveform design and receive signal processing. As a step further, we provide our vision on the deeper integration between S\&C within the framework of perceptive networks, where the two functionalities are expected to mutually assist each other, i.e., via communication-assisted sensing and sensing-assisted communications. Finally, we identify the potential integration of ISAC with other emerging communication technologies, and their positive impacts on the future of wireless networks.},

While MLPs have fixed activation functions on nodes (``neurons''), KANs have learnable activation functions on edges (``weights''). KANs have no linear weights at all -- every weight parameter is replaced by a univariate function parametrized as a spline. We show that this seemingly simple change makes KANs outperform MLPs in terms of accuracy and interpretability. For accuracy, much smaller KANs can achieve comparable or better accuracy than much larger MLPs in data fitting and PDE solving. Theoretically and empirically, KANs possess faster neural scaling laws than MLPs. For interpretability, KANs can be intuitively visualized and can easily interact with human users. Through two examples in mathematics and physics, KANs are shown to be useful ``collaborators'' helping scientists (re)discover mathematical and physical laws. In summary, KANs are promising alternatives for MLPs, opening opportunities for further improving today's deep learning models which rely heavily on MLPs.},

To address the issue, we propose to use RF tag arrays for activity monitoring, where data mining techniques play a critical role. The RFID technology provides an economically attractive solution due to the low cost of RF tags and readers. Another novelty of this design is that the tracking objects do not need to be equipped with any RF transmitters or receivers.

The low-power and low-complexity backscatter communications (BackCom), which simply relies on passive reflection and modulation of an incident radio-frequency (RF) wave, has emerged to be a promising technology for tackling this challenge. However, the contemporary BackCom has several major limitations, such as short transmission range, low data rate, and uni-directional information transmission. The article aims at introducing the recent advances in the active area of BackCom. Specifically, we provide a systematic introduction of the next generation BackCom covering basic principles, systems, techniques besides IoT applications.

Our reconstruction method is noniterative (though approximating the projection step may use an iterative procedure) and highly efficient, and it is shown to attain the near-optimal statistical rate of order (k log L)/m, where m is the number of measurements. We consider two specific instances of the SIM, namely noisy 1-bit and cubic measurement models, and perform experiments on image datasets to demonstrate the efficacy of our method. In particular, for the noisy 1-bit measurement model, we show that our non-iterative method significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art iterative method in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.},

To avoid the limitations from regular deployment, the base station deployment is modeled as an optimization problem. This paper focuses on four-station time difference of arrival (TDOA) based localization system, we propose a Modified Firefly Algorithm (MFA) to design an optimal base station deployment strategy considering the TDOA measurement error and the base station positioning error. Geometrical Dilution of Precision (GDOP) is used as performance metric to evaluate performance of the proposed MFA based deployment method. Simulation results show that MFA can accelerate convergence efficiently and on the premise of satisfying certain positioning accuracy requirements, MFA based deployment can increase the coverage of GDOP by nearly 10\%, comparing to SFA based deployment.},

  abstract = {Accurate rainfall measurement is essential for flood forecasting, effective water resources management, agriculture, etc. Many traditional rainfall monitoring methods, such as rainfall gauges, weather radars, and satellites, have been developed. Recently, a rainfall retrieval algorithm based on the radio connection between one telephone tower and another has seen widespread use across countries as it does not require any deployment procedures or costs. However, because underground fibre-optic cable networks have been widely introduced and deployed between telephone towers, usage of rainfall retrieval algorithms has reduced. Measurement report (MR) data from time-division long term evolution (TD-LTE) networks for providing instructions to the user terminal has the potential to estimate rainfall owing to the impact of rainfall-based attenuation on MR data. We present an analysis of MR data collected during the local flood season over 2 months (May and August 2019) in Huizhou city, southern China. Comparisons between estimated and observed rainfall exhibit promising results. Rainfall estimation from MR data is a potential alternative/complementary rainfall estimation method, as well as having use in runoff simulations, with acceptable accuracy ({$>$}0.8); this is particularly relevant in the context of disappearing microwave links between telephone towers in cellular communication networks. The rainfall estimation method proposed herein can also be implemented in rarely gauged or ungauged areas for flood simulation.},

However, most of the existing PIR-based localization systems only utilize the binary information of PIR sensors and therefore require a large number of carefully deployed PIR sensors. A few works directly map the raw data of PIR sensors to one's location using machine learning approaches. However, these data-driven approaches require abundant training data and suffer from environmental change. In this paper, we propose PIRATES, a PIR-based device-free localization system based on the raw data of PIR sensors. The key of PIRATES is to extract a new type of location information called azimuth change. The extraction of the azimuth change relies on the physical properties of PIR sensors. Therefore, no abundant training data are needed and the system is robust to environmental change. Through experiments, we demonstrate that PIRATES can achieve higher localization accuracy than the state-of-the-art approaches. In addition, the information of the azimuth change can be easily incorporated with other information of PIR signals (e.g. amplitude) to improve the localization accuracy.},

The sensor is fabricated by fusion splicing a short section of HCF between two singlemode fibers (SMFs).

In this survey, we categorize ADL into model-driven ADL and data-driven ADL by whether its selector is model driven or data driven. We also introduce the different characteristics of the two major types of ADL, respectively. We summarized three fundamental factors in the designation of a selector. We pointed out that, with the development of deep learning, the selector in ADL also is experiencing the stage from model driven to data driven. The advantages and disadvantages between data-driven ADL and model-driven ADL are thoroughly analyzed. Furthermore, different sub-classes of data-drive or model-driven ADL are also summarized and discussed emphatically. Finally, we survey the trend of ADL from model driven to data driven.},

  abstract = {Identifying an object's spatial direction (or orientation) plays a fundamental role in a variety of applications, such as automatic assembly, indoor navigation, and robot driving. In this paper, we design a fine-grained direction finding system called Tag-Compass that attaches a single tag to an object (whose size may be small) and identifies the tagged object's orientation by determining the spatial direction of the tag. We exploit the polarization properties of the RF waves used in the communications between an RFID reader and the tag on the object. Polarization mismatch between the tag and the reader's antenna affects the received signal strength at the reader. From the measured signal strength values, we are able to deduce the tag's direction through a series of transformations and deviation minimization. We propose a system design for Tag-Compass and implement a prototype. We evaluate the performance of TagCompass through extensive experiments using the prototype. The experimental results show that Tag-Compass provides accurate direction estimates with a median error of just 2.5{$^\circ$} when the tag's position is known and a median error of 3.8{$^\circ$} when the tag's position is unknown.},

  abstract = {Sleep monitoring plays an important role in many medical applications, including SIDS prevention, care of patients with pressure ulcers, and assistance to patients with sleep apnea, where studies have shown that autonomous and continuous monitoring of sleep postures provides useful information for lowering health risk. Existing systems are designed based on electrocardiogram, cameras and pressure sensors, which are expensive to deploy, intrusive to privacy, or uncomfortable to use. This paper presents TagSheet, the first sleep monitoring system based on passive RFID tags, which provides a convenient, non-intrusive, and comfortable way of monitoring the sleeping postures. It does not require attaching any tag directly to a patient's body. Tags are taped under a bed sheet. With a combination of hierarchical recognition, image processing and polynomial fitting, the proposed system identifies body postures based on the observed variation caused by the patient body to the backscattered signals from tags. The system does not require any personalized data training, making it plug-n-play in use. One additional advantage is that the system can also estimate the patient's respiration rate. This is particularly helpful in assisting patients with sleep apnea. We have implemented a prototype system, and experiments show that the system performs posture identification with an accuracy up to 96.7\% and in the meantime it measures the respiration rate with a small error of about 0.7 bpm (breath per minute).},

  abstract = {People usually assess fruit qualities from external features such as color, shape, size, and texture. However, it is quite common that we select fruits with perfect appearances but rotten inside, especially for fruits with thick pericarps. Thus the accurate measurement is desirable to evaluate the internal conditions of fruits. As two key features of fruit internal qualities, existing methods on measuring fruit moisture and soluble solid contents (SSC) are either destructive or costly, limiting their adoption in daily life. In this paper, we propose Wi-Fruit, a non-destructive and low-cost fruit moisture and SSC measurement system leveraging Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI). First, to cope with the fruit structure dependency challenge, we propose a double-quotient model to pre-process CSI on adjacent antennas. Second, to address the fruit size and type dependency challenges, a lightweight artificial neural network (ANN) model with visual information fusion is proposed for fruit moisture and SSC estimations. Extensive evaluations are conducted on 6 types of fruits with both thick (i.e., watermelon and grapefruit) and thin pericarps (i.e., dragon fruit, apple, pear, and orange) over a month in either an empty laboratory room or a library with massive books. Results demonstrate that Wi-Fruit achieves an acceptable estimation accuracy (RMSE=0.319). It is independent of various fruit structures, sizes, and types, while also robust to time and environmental changes. The fruit internal sensing capabilities of Wi-Fruit can help fruit saving and safety in both pre-harvest and post-harvest applications.},

However, until now the effectiveness of existing CTCs, which rely on packet-level modulation, is limited due to their low throughput (e.g., tens of bps). Our work, named WEBee, opens a promising direction for high-throughput CTC via physical-level emulation. WEBee uses a high-speed wireless radio (e.g., WiFi OFDM) to emulate the desired signals of a low-speed radio (e.g., ZigBee). Our unique emulation technique manipulates only the payload of WiFi packets, requiring neither hardware nor firmware changes in commodity technologies -- a feature allowing zero-cost fast deployment on existing WiFi infrastructure. We designed and implemented WEBee with commodity devices (Atheros AR2425 WiFi card and MicaZ CC2420) and the USRP-N210 platform (for PHY layer evaluation). Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that WEBee can achieve a more than 99\% reliable parallel CTC between WiFi and ZigBee with 126 Kbps in noisy environments, a throughput about 16,000x faster than current state-of-the-art CTCs.},

  abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising technology to reconfigure wireless channels, which brings a new degree of freedom for the design of future wireless networks. This article proposes a new three-dimensional (3D) wireless system architecture enabled by aerial IRS (AIRS). Compared to the conventional terrestrial IRS, AIRS enjoys more deployment flexibility as well as wider-view signal reflection, thanks to its high altitude and thus more likelihood of establishing line-of-sight (LoS) links with ground source/destination nodes. We aim to maximize the worst-case signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over all locations in a target area by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming for the source node, as well as the placement and 3D passive beamforming for the AIRS. The formulated problem is non-convex and difficult to solve. To gain useful insights, we first consider the special case of maximizing the SNR at a given target location, for which the optimal solution is obtained in closed-form. The result shows that the optimal horizontal AIRS placement only depends on the ratio between the source-destination distance and the AIRS altitude. Then for the general case of AIRS-enabled area coverage, we propose an efficient solution by decoupling the AIRS passive beamforming design to maximize the worst-case array gain, from its placement optimization by balancing the resulting angular span and the cascaded channel path loss. Our proposed solution is based on a novel 3D beam broadening and flattening technique, where the passive array of the AIRS is divided into sub-arrays of appropriate size, and their phase shifts are designed to form a flattened beam pattern with adjustable beamwidth catering to the size of the coverage area. Both uniform linear array (ULA)-based and uniform planar array (UPA)-based AIRSs are considered in our design, which enable two-dimensional (2D) and 3D passive beamforming, respectively. Numerical results show that the proposed designs achieve significant performance gains over the benchmark schemes.},

The received power data are processed, using a novel approach, to identify rain events and to remove the wet antenna effect, with the aim of accurately quantifying the fade induced by precipitation, AR. Moreover, AR is estimated by taking advantage of the ancillary data collected by the laser-based disdrometer collocated with the link transceivers. The results definitely point out the higher prediction accuracy achieved by exploiting the information on the rain drop size. A full year of data are used as reference to test the accuracy of the statistical prediction model for terrestrial links currently recommended by the ITU-R, which reveals a large overestimation. Finally, alternative models providing a higher accuracy are proposed and their accuracy assessed.},

  abstract = {Millimeter wave (mmWave) technology enables wireless devices to communicate using very high-frequency signals. Operating at those frequencies provides larger bandwidth which can be used to enable high-data-rate links, and very accurate localization of devices. However, radios operating at high-frequencies consume significant amount of power, making them unsuitable for applications with limited energy sources. This paper presents MilBack, a backscatter network operating at mmWave bands. Backscattering is the most energy-efficient wireless communication technique, where nodes piggyback their data on an access point's signal instead of generating their own signals. Eliminating the need for signal generation significantly reduces the energy-consumption of the nodes. In contrast to past mmWave backscatter work which supports only uplink, MilBack is the first mmWave backscatter network which supports uplink, downlink, and accurate localization. MilBack addresses the key challenges that prevent existing backscatter networks to enable both uplink and downlink at mmWave bands. We implemented MilBack and evaluated its performance empirically. Our results show that MilBack is capable of achieving accurate localization, uplink, and downlink communication at up to 8 m while consuming only 32 mW and 18 mW, respectively.},

  abstract = {Solar energy constitutes an effective supplement to traditional energy sources. However, photovoltaic power generation (PVPG) is strongly weather-dependent, and thus highly intermittent. High-precision forecasting of PVPG forms the basis of the production, transmission, and distribution of electricity, ensuring the stability and reliability of power systems. In this work, we propose a deep learning based framework for accurate PVPG forecasting. In particular, taking advantage of the long short-term memory (LSTM) network in solving sequential-data based regression problems, this paper considers the specific domain knowledge of PV and proposes a physics-constrained LSTM (PC-LSTM) to forecast the hourly day-ahead PVPG. It aims to overcome the shortcoming of recent machine learning algorithms that are applied based only on massive data, and thus easily producing unreasonable forecasts. Real-life PV datasets are adopted to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of the models. Sensitivity analysis is conducted for the selection of input feature variables based on a two-stage hybrid method. The results indicate that the proposed PC-LSTM model possesses stronger forecasting capability than the standard LSTM model. It is more robust against PVPG forecasting, and more suitable for PVPG forecasting with sparse data in practice. The PC-LSTM model also demonstrates superior performance with higher accuracy of PVPG forecasting compared to conventional machine learning and statistical methods.},

The current solutions based on inertial, radio frequency, and geomagnetic sensing may have degraded performance when their limiting factors take effect. In this paper, we present a new indoor simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system that utilizes the smartphone's built-in audio hardware and inertial measurement unit (IMU). Our system uses a smartphone's loud-speaker to emit near-inaudible chirps and then the microphone to record the acoustic echoes from the indoor environment. Our profiling measurements show that the echoes carry location information with sub-meter granularity. To enable SLAM, we apply contrastive learning to construct an echoic location feature (ELF) extractor, such that the loop closures on the smartphone's trajectory can be accurately detected from the associated ELF trace. The detection results effectively regulate the IMU-based trajectory reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our ELF-based SLAM achieves median localization errors of 0.1 m, 0.53 m, and 0.4m on the reconstructed trajectories in a living room, an office, and a shopping mall, and outperforms the Wi-Fi and geomagnetic SLAM systems.},

  abstract = {Joint radar and communication (JRC) has recently attracted substantial attention. The first reason is that JRC allows individual radar and communication systems to share spectrum bands and thus improves the spectrum utilization. The second reason is that JRC enables a single hardware platform, e.g., an autonomous vehicle or a UAV, to simultaneously perform the communication function and the radar function. As a result, JRC is able to improve the efficiency of resources, i.e., spectrum and energy, reduce the system size, and minimize the system cost. However, there are several challenges to be solved for the JRC design. In particular, sharing the spectrum imposes the interference caused by the systems, and sharing the hardware platform and energy resource complicates the design of the JRC transmitter and compromises the performance of each function. To address the challenges, several resource management approaches have been recently proposed, and this paper presents a comprehensive literature review on resource management for JRC. First, we give fundamental concepts of JRC, important performance metrics used in JRC systems, and applications of the JRC systems. Then, we review and analyze resource management approaches, i.e., spectrum sharing, power allocation, and interference management, for JRC. In addition, we present security issues to JRC and provide a discussion of countermeasures to the security issues. Finally, we highlight important challenges in the JRC design and discuss future research directions related to JRC.},

The first category operates with off-the-shelf narrowband RFID tags but makes restrictive assumptions on the environment or the tag's movement patterns. The second category does not make such restrictive assumptions; however, it requires designing new ultra-wideband hardware for RFIDs and uses the large bandwidth to directly compute a tag's 3D location. Hence, while the first category is restrictive, the second one requires replacing the billions of RFIDs already produced and deployed annually. This paper presents RFind, a new technology that brings the benefits of ultra-wideband localization to the billions of RFIDs in today's world. RFind does not require changing today's passive narrowband RFID tags. Instead, it leverages their underlying physical properties to emulate a very large bandwidth and uses it for localization. Our empirical results demonstrate that RFind can emulate over 220MHz of bandwidth on tags designed with a communication bandwidth of only tens to hundreds of kHz, while remaining compliant with FCC regulations. This, combined with a new super-resolution algorithm over this bandwidth, enables RFind to perform 3D localization with sub-centimeter accuracy in each of the x/y/z dimensions, without making any restrictive assumptions on the tag's motion or the environment.},

  abstract = {We propose and demonstrate accurate 3D real-time indoor localization via broadband nonlinear backscatter in passive devices. The proposed method does not need any relative motion between a reader and a tag or the use of reference anchor nodes. In the conventional radio frequency identification (RFID) system, a passive tag responds to a reader by switching its antenna "on" and "off". The operation of such conventional backscatter is essentially "linear", since the reader-to-tag (downlink) and tag-to-reader (uplink) signals overlap on the same carrier frequency. Although linear backscatter is straightforward, the self-jamming problem caused by strong leakage signals from the transmitter to the receiver is notorious and poses many constraints on the received signal quality, operation bandwidth, modulation flexibility and system complexity. To enable high-accuracy real-time 3D indoor localization for passive devices, we show that nonlinear backscatter is more effective than linear backscatter. Nonlinear backscatter exploits nonlinear elements in passive devices to generate second or higher-order harmonics as the uplink response. Separation of downlink and uplink on different carriers allows immediate self-jamming cancellation and direct un-modulated carrier phase decoding, hence resulting in better received signal quality and broad bandwidth of operation, both of which are critical for the localization system. The broad bandwidth allows the design of an efficient phase-based ranging algorithm - heuristic multi-frequency continuous wave (HMFCW) ranging which resolves ambiguous phase cycles with heuristically optimized sparse carrier frequencies. HMFCW ranging can correctly pin down the phase cycle integer with 100\% reliability as long as the phase error falls within {\textpm}90{$^\circ$} {\texttimes} BW\% (percentage bandwidth). In our present implementation, we achieved a median ranging error below 1 cm under phase error bounds of {\textpm}50{$^\circ$}. We realized real-time 3D localization from differential ranging by nonlinear conjugate gradient (CG) search for hyperboloids intersection in a multi-static transceiving system with 1 Tx antenna and 4 Rx antennas. The measured 3D localization median error was 3.5 cm in the indoor environment. Presently, the measurement latency was less than 0.155 seconds. We will present system design, algorithms and a prototype with experimental evaluation.},

By 2020, it is estimated that the total number of Internet-connected devices being used will be between 25 and 50 billion. As these numbers grow and technologies become more mature, the volume of data being published will increase. The technology of Internet-connected devices, referred to as Internet of Things (IoT), continues to extend the current Internet by providing connectivity and interactions between the physical and cyber worlds. In addition to an increased volume, the IoT generates big data characterized by its velocity in terms of time and location dependency, with a variety of multiple modalities and varying data quality. Intelligent processing and analysis of this big data are the key to developing smart IoT applications. This article assesses the various machine learning methods that deal with the challenges presented by IoT data by considering smart cities as the main use case. The key contribution of this study is the presentation of a taxonomy of machine learning algorithms explaining how different techniques are applied to the data in order to extract higher level information. The potential and challenges of machine learning for IoT data analytics will also be discussed. A use case of applying a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to Aarhus smart city traffic data is presented for a more detailed exploration.},

  abstract = {Optical Camera Communication (OCC) applications have intensively used in recent years. Underwater Optical Wireless Communications (UWOC) are one of the most viable alternatives today in underwater environments, compared to traditional acoustic communications or radio communications. UWOC present important and remarkable advantages such as their available bandwidth and the possibility of using COTS devices already present in underwater environments such as LED lighting lamps. This work proposes using a multispectral or hyperspectral camera as an OCC receiver, in short range underwater links, to take advantage of the high spectral resolution of this type of devices regarding conventional cameras. Furthermore, spectral features of the LEDs, usually used as transmitters in OCC, are affected by temperature. Hence, one of the goals of this work is to benefit from those spectral variations that will be grasped by the multispectral camera and thus achieve a new data channel. Therefore, different communication channels could be obtained from a single light source.},

This paper develops high-preCision Acoustic Tracker (CAT), which aims to replace a traditional mouse and let a user play games, interact with VR/AR headsets, and control smart appliances by moving a smartphone in the air. Achieving high tracking accuracy is essential to provide enjoyable user experience. To this end, we develop a novel system that uses audio signals to achieve mm-level tracking accuracy. It lets multiple speakers transmit inaudible sounds at different frequencies. Based on the received sound, our system continuously estimates the distance and velocity of the mobile with respect to the speakers to continuously track it. At its heart lies a distributed Frequency Modulated Continuous Waveform (FMCW) that can accurately estimate the absolute distance between a transmitter and a receiver that are separate and unsynchronized. We further develop an optimization framework to combine FMCW estimation with Doppler shifts and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) measurements to enhance the accuracy, and efficiently solve the optimization problem. We implement two systems: one on a desktop and another on a mobile phone. Our evaluation and user study show that our system achieves high tracking accuracy and ease of use using existing hardware.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel object tracking system, named STABack, that utilizes backscatter tags and accelerometer sensors. The system is designed to support high-speed movement tracking with high accuracy. One of the challenges faced in this system is the instability of the received signal due to the motion and rotation of the backscatter tag. To address this issue, we propose an amplitude stabilization algorithm to eliminate the interference caused by the tag's motion. The algorithm uses envelope detection to remove the impact of high-frequency motion on the signal, and a dynamic threshold output to further reduce the bit error rate of backscatter demodulation. Additionally, we perform outliers removal and interpolation on the three-axis accelerometer data and compute the attitude angle using 3D geometric quadrants. Finally, we implement the prototype of STABack and evaluate its performance. Our method improves BER up to 0.3757 compared with the regular demodulation method. Our evaluation of the STABack prototype shows that it achieves a median distance measurement accuracy of 6.45 cm with a standard deviation of 6.95 cm. The mean error of the attitude angle estimation is less than 7 degrees, and the average relative error of three-axis acceleration tracking is only 0.097. The system's accuracy in detecting the target object's trajectory is as high as 98\%, and it can still decode with a bit error rate of no more than 0.034 at a speed of 166 cm/s. The power consumption of backscatter communication is 38.54{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}mu{\textbackslash}mathrmW. Based on our experimental results, Overall, our results demonstrate that STABack can accurately estimate the movement and rotation of target objects in unstable backscatter channels.},

Using an exact wave propagation formulation involving the plane-wave spectral decompositions of the transmitted and scattered fields, we show that the behavior of wireless links based on arrays of polarimetric antennas is qualitatively different than that of links based on single polarimetric antennas. The MIMO channel can be viewed rigorously in the wavenumber domain. For dense planar arrays, the use of polarimetric antennas yields at most a fourfold improvement in capacity, which can be realized by particular combinations of four of the six dipoles. Six-component elements, the expansion of the planar arrays into volume arrays, or spacing elements at intervals less than a half-wavelength only give additional logarithmic improvements in capacity.},

In particular, many emerging applications require streaming rich content (such as videos) in real time, while they are constrained by energy sources. A wireless network which supports high data-rate while consuming low-power would be very attractive for these applications. Unfortunately, existing wireless networks do not satisfy this requirement. For example, WiFi backscatter and Bluetooth networks have very low power consumption, but their data-rate is very limited (less than a Mbps). On the other hand, modern WiFi and mmWave networks support high throughput, but have a high power consumption (more than a watt).To address this problem, we present mmTag, a novel mmWave backscatter network which enables low-power high-throughput wireless links for emerging applications. mmTag is a backscatter system which operates in the mmWave frequency bands. mmTag addresses the key challenges that prevent existing backscatter networks from operating at mmWave bands. We implemented mmTag and evaluated its performance empirically. Our results show that mmTag is capable of achieving 1 Gbps and 100 Mbps at 4.6 m and 8 m, respectively, while consuming only 2.4 nJ/bit.},

  abstract = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) can be densely deployed in complex environment to create cascaded line-ofsight (LoS) paths between multiple base stations (BSs) and users via tunable IRS reflections, thereby significantly enhancing the coverage performance of wireless networks. To achieve this goal, it is vital to optimize the deployed locations of BSs and IRSs in the wireless network, which is investigated in this paper. Specifically, we divide the coverage area of the network into multiple non-overlapping cells and decide whether to deploy a BS/IRS in each cell given a total number of BSs/IRSs available. We show that to ensure the network coverage/communication performance, i.e., each cell has a direct/cascaded LoS path with at least one BS, as well as such LoS paths have the average number of IRS reflections less than a given threshold, there is a fundamental trade-off with the deployment cost or the number of BSs/IRSs needed. To optimally characterize this trade-off, we formulate a joint BS and IRS deployment problem based on graph theory, which, however, is difficult to be optimally solved due to the combinatorial optimization involved. To circumvent this difficulty, we first consider a simplified problem with given BS deployment and propose the optimal as well as an efficient suboptimal IRS deployment solution to it, by applying the branch-and-bound method and iteratively removing IRSs from the candidate locations, respectively. Next, an efficient sequential update algorithm is proposed for solving the joint BS and IRS deployment problem. Numerical results are provided to show the efficacy of the proposed design approach and optimization algorithms for the joint BS and IRS deployment. The trade-off between the network coverage performance and the number of deployed BSs/IRSs with different cost ratios is also unveiled.},

  abstract = {The ever increasing proliferation of wireless objects and consistent connectivity demands are creating significant challenges for battery-constrained wireless devices. The vision of massive IoT, involving billions of smart objects to be connected to the cellular network, needs to address the problem of uninterrupted power consumption while taking advantage of emerging high-frequency 5G communications. The problem of limited battery power motivates us to utilize radio frequency (RF) signals as the energy source for battery-free communications in next-generation wireless networks. Backscatter communication (BackCom) makes it possible to harvest energy from incident RF signals and reflect back parts of the same signals while modulating the data. Ambient BackCom (Amb-BackCom) is a type of BackCom that can harvest energy from nearby WiFi, TV, and cellular RF signals to modulate information. The objective of this article is to review BackCom as a solution to the limited battery life problem and enable future battery-free communications for combating the energy issues for devices in emerging wireless networks. We first highlight the energy constraint in existing wireless communications. We then investigate BackCom as a practical solution to the limited battery life problem. Subsequently, in order to take the advantages of omnipresent radio waves, we elaborate BackCom tag architecture and various types of BackCom. To understand encoding and data extraction, we demonstrate signal processing aspects that cover channel coding, interference, decoding, and signal detection schemes. Moreover, we also describe BackCom communication modes, modulation schemes, and multiple access techniques to accommodate maximum users with high throughput. Similarly, to mitigate the increased network energy, adequate data and power transfer schemes for BackCom are elaborated, in addition to reliability, security, and range extension. Finally, we highlight BackCom applications with existing research challenges and future directions for next-generation 5G wireless networks.},

Since the power of Wi-Fi transceivers (10s-to-100s of mW) can be prohibitively high for emerging classes of IoT devices (which desire {$<$}; 100{$\mu$}W), recent work has suggested piggybacking baseband signals from the IoT device directly on top of incident Wi-Fi signals generated by access points (APs) via Wi-Fi-compatible backscatter modulation [1-4], where as low as 28{$\mu$}W of active power has been demonstrated [4]. However, the major limitation of this approach is range: signals generated by the transmitting AP experience 1/d2 path loss to the backscattering tag, which has insertion loss PL,ins to perform single-side band (SSB) modulation, and then re-radiated modulated signals back to the receiving AP (or to another AP) experience an additional 1/d2 path loss, resulting in an overall loss {$\propto$} 1/d4 + PL,ins. With no active RF amplification, the tag in [4] experienced PL,ins=15dB, limiting AP-to-tag-and-back-to-AP distance to 10m, which is not sufficient in many single-AP homes.},

  abstract = {Sign language recognition is emerging as a vital component of our smart life. In addition, commercial RFID shall become a popular technology for sign language recognition. As we all know, there are 70 million deaf people using sign language as their first language and sign language can facilitate communication with deaf people. However, most of the researches are isolated word recognition. There is few researches about sentence-level sign language recognition. More importantly, they are limited and it is difficult to achieve the desired results of realworld applications. So this paper introduces the first sentence-level sign language recognition system based on RFID. It mainly collects the phase sequence of signals received by commercial RFID device. We obtain relatively pure phase characteristics and present a method to carry out sign language segmentation. Effective feature extraction and classifier selection are crucial to sign language recognition. By evaluating our system in real-word environment, we fill in the gaps between corresponding low-cost sentence-level sign language recognition. We implement and evaluate through extensive experiments and the average accuracy of the method are 96\% and 98.11\% in different multipath scenarios. The results show that our method has high recognition accuracy and robustness.},

The recent availability of mobile device power measurements enriched by GPS position, the so-called 3GPP minimization of drive test (MDT) feature, nowadays, empowers new approaches to propagation studies targeting mobile service and quality improvements. The novelty of the research presented in this article is the use of a huge quantity of MDT geolocated radio measurements in a connected state (more than 370 million during the three-day MDT campaign) along 187 km of Italian A22 Motorway, part of the planned Munich-Bologna EU cross-border corridors for connected and automated mobility (CAM). In particular, MDT measurements of LTE received signal received power (RSRP) are compared between rain and dry road situations, showing how wet environments reshape electromagnetic propagation, even for LTE frequency bands (below 3 GHz) that have line-of-sight propagation marginally influenced by rain. Explanations of measured effects and simulations are presented. The rain effect on cellular propagation should be carefully considered in the perspective of connected car evolution, specifically considering new worldwide available 5G bands, more affected by rain situations, and autonomous driving scenarios.},

In this paper, we propose an au-toregressive prior for 3D shapes to solve multimodal 3D tasks such as shape completion, reconstruction, and gener-ation. We model the distribution over 3D shapes as a non-sequential autoregressive distribution over a discretized, low-dimensional, symbolic grid-like latent representation of 3D shapes. This enables us to represent distributions over 3D shapes conditioned on information from an arbitrary set of spatially anchored query locations and thus perform shape completion in such arbitrary settings (e.g. generating a complete chair given only a view of the back leg). We also show that the learned autoregressive prior can be leveraged for conditional tasks such as single-view reconstruction and language-based generation. This is achieved by learning task-specific `naive' conditionals which can be approxi-mated by light-weight models trained on minimal paired data. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method using both quantitative and qualitative evaluation and show that the proposed method outperforms the specialized state-of-the-art methods trained for individual tasks.

  abstract = {Deep learning models have achieved remarkable success in many different fields and attracted many interests. Several researchers attempted to apply deep learning models to synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data processing, but it did not have the same breakthrough as the other fields, including optical remote sensing. SAR data are in complex domain by nature and processing them with real-valued (RV) networks neglects the phase component which conveys important and distinctive information. A complex-valued (CV) end-to-end deep network is developed in this study for the reconstruction and classification of CV-SAR data. Azimuth subaperture decomposition is utilized to incorporate physics-aware attributes of the CV-SAR into the deep model. Moreover, the correlation coefficient amplitude (coherence) of the CV-SAR images depends on the SAR system characteristics and physical properties of the target. This coherency should be considered and preserved in the processing chain of the CV-SAR data. The coherency preservation of the CV deep networks for CV-SAR images, which is mostly neglected in the literature, is evaluated in this study. Furthermore, a large-scale CV-SAR annotated dataset for the evaluation of the CV deep networks is lacking. A semantically annotated CVSAR dataset from Sentinel-1 single look complex stripmap mode data [S1SLC\_CVDL (complex-valued deep learning) dataset] is developed and introduced in this study. The experimental analysis demonstrated the better performance of the developed CV deep network for CV-SAR data classification and reconstruction in comparison with the equivalent RV model and more complicated RV architectures, as well as its coherency preservation and physics-aware capability.},

In addition, in some conditions, it needs not only measuring water level but also needs to measure the volume and control water surplus or deficiency. To solve these issues, this paper proposes an accurate non-contact water measurement system based on a microcontroller and an ultrasonic sensor to measure the level and volume of liquids in small tanks without any contact. The proposed system also provides automatically controlling the water level with an alarm system to provide early warning of water surplus or deficiency. Microcontroller PIC16F877A is used to drive the sensor circuit and measure the time change of the reflected echoes from the water surface received by the ultrasonic (PING) sensor that correspond to the changes in the water level. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed system to measure the level and volume of water over 30 cm range with small error rates (SSE = 0.033 cm, RMSE = 0.034 cm and MAE = 0.029 cm for level measurement and SSE = 0.025 liter, RMSE = 0.026 liter and MAE = 0.021 liter for volume measurement) and excellent correlation coefficients (SCC = 0.9997 and KCC = 0.9951), thus provide accurate results for continuous measurement of the water level and volume in industrial applications.},

In this work, we propose a general framework to directly embed the notion of an incompressible fluid into Convolutional Neural Networks, and apply this to coarse-graining of turbulent flow. These physics-embedded neural networks leverage interpretable strategies from numerical methods and computational fluid dynamics to enforce physical laws and boundary conditions by taking advantage the mathematical properties of the underlying equations. We demonstrate results on three-dimensional fully-developed turbulence, showing that this technique drastically improves local conservation of mass, without sacrificing performance according to several other metrics characterizing the fluid flow.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is leading today's digital transformation. Relying on a combination of technologies, protocols, and devices such as wireless sensors and newly developed wearable and implanted sensors, IoT is changing every aspect of daily life, especially recent applications in digital healthcare. IoT incorporates various kinds of hardware, communication protocols, and services. This IoT diversity can be viewed as a double-edged sword that provides comfort to users but can lead also to a large number of security threats and attacks. In this survey paper, a new compacted and optimized architecture for IoT is proposed based on five layers. Likewise, we propose a new classification of security threats and attacks based on new IoT architecture. The IoT architecture involves a physical perception layer, a network and protocol layer, a transport layer, an application layer, and a data and cloud services layer. First, the physical sensing layer incorporates the basic hardware used by IoT. Second, we highlight the various network and protocol technologies employed by IoT, and review the security threats and solutions. Transport protocols are exhibited and the security threats against them are discussed while providing common solutions. Then, the application layer involves application protocols and lightweight encryption algorithms for IoT. Finally, in the data and cloud services layer, the main important security features of IoT cloud platforms are addressed, involving confidentiality, integrity, authorization, authentication, and encryption protocols. The paper is concluded by presenting the open research issues and future directions towards securing IoT, including the lack of standardized lightweight encryption algorithms, the use of machine-learning algorithms to enhance security and the related challenges, the use of Blockchain to address security challenges in IoT, and the implications of IoT deployment in 5G and beyond.},

  abstract = {The concept of distributed transmit beamforming is implicit in many key results of network information theory. However, its implementation in a wireless network involves the fundamental challenge of ensuring phase coherence of the radio frequency signals from the different transmitters in the presence of unknown phase offsets between the transmitters and unknown channel gains from the transmitters to the receiver. In this paper, it is shown that such phase alignment can be achieved using distributed adaptation by the transmitters with minimal feedback from the receiver. Specifically, each transmitter independently makes a small random adjustment to its phase at each iteration, while the receiver broadcasts a single bit of feedback, indicating whether the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improved or worsened after the current iteration. The transmitters keep the {\textquestiondown}good{\textquestiondown} phase adjustments and discard the {\textquestiondown}bad{\textquestiondown} ones, thus implementing a distributed ascent algorithm. It is shown that, for a broad class of distributions for the random phase adjustments, this procedure leads to asymptotic phase coherence with probability one. A simple analytical model, borrowing ideas from statistical mechanics, is used to characterize the progress of the algorithm, and to provide guidance on parameter choices. This analytical model is based on a conjecture on the distribution of the received phases when the number of transmitters becomes large. Finally, the proposed system is shown to be scalable: the random phase perturbations can be chosen such that the convergence time is linear in the number of collaborating nodes.},

By deploying BackComm in UAV-enabled IoT system allows an efficient utilization of the network resources, especially, in remote areas and smart cities.

Closed-form expressions are derived to study the system performance through outage probability and average BER. Additionally, we obtain a simplified asymptotic expression in a high SNR regime, from which we gain insight into how the channel and system parameters affect the overall performance.

A millimeter-wave Doppler sensor is developed to ``see'' (i.e., sense) through a target container and measure the liquid level on the basis of the absorption of millimeter waves in liquid. One of the challenges is to accurately measure liquid level (within sub-millimeter error) despite the inherently large beam diameter of the millimeter wave due to diffraction. A piezoelectric vibrator enables accurate measurement by reflecting a limited portion of the spread beam and modulating it in frequency to distinguish it from the other portion of the beam. A prototype measurement system is fabricated and evaluated. The feasibility of our proposed method for clearly detecting an air-liquid interface concealed in an opaque container is confirmed experimentally. The nonlinearity error of the measured liquid level is within {\textpm}0.5 mm .},

We demonstrate how a smartphone and portable speaker playing music with embedded, inaudible signals can track multiple individuals' locations and activities both within a room and through barriers in 2D space. We achieve this by transforming a smartphone into an active sonar system that emits a combination of a sonar pulse and music and listens to the reflections off of humans in the environment. Our implementation, CovertBand, monitors minute changes to these reflections to track multiple people concurrently and to recognize different types of motion, leaking information about where people are in addition to what they may be doing. We evaluated CovertBand by running experiments in five homes in the Seattle area, showing that we can localize both single and multiple individuals through barriers. These tests show CovertBand can track walking subjects with a mean tracking error of 18 cm and subjects moving at a fixed position with an accuracy of 8 cm at up to 6 m in line-of-sight and 3 m through barriers. We test a variety of rhythmic motions such as pumping arms, jumping, and supine pelvic tilts in through-wall scenarios and show that they produce discernibly different spectrograms from walking in the acoustic reflections. In tests with 33 subjects, we also show that even in ideal scenarios, listeners were unlikely to detect a CovertBand attack.},

We study the resource allocation algorithm design for maximization of the energy efficiency of data transmission (bits/Joule delivered to the receivers). In particular, we focus on power splitting hybrid receivers which are able to split the received signals into two power streams for concurrent information decoding and energy harvesting. Two scenarios are investigated considering different power splitting abilities of the receivers. In the first scenario, we assume receivers which can split the received power into a continuous set of power streams with arbitrary power splitting ratios. In the second scenario, we examine receivers which can split the received power only into a discrete set of power streams with fixed power splitting ratios. For both scenarios, we formulate the corresponding algorithm design as a non-convex optimization problem which takes into account the circuit power consumption, the minimum data rate requirements of delay constrained services, the minimum required system data rate, and the minimum amount of power that has to be delivered to the receivers. By exploiting fractional programming and dual decomposition, suboptimal iterative resource allocation algorithms are developed to solve the non-convex problems. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed iterative resource allocation algorithms approach the optimal solution within a small number of iterations and unveil the trade-off between energy efficiency, system capacity, and wireless power transfer: (1) wireless power transfer enhances the system energy efficiency by harvesting energy in the radio frequency, especially in the interference limited regime; (2) the presence of multiple receivers is beneficial for the system capacity, but not necessarily for the system energy efficiency.},

We present LANDMARC, a location sensing prototype system that uses Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology for locating objects inside buildings. The major advantage of LANDMARC is that it improves the overall accuracy of locating objects by utilizing the concept of reference tags.

  abstract = {Respiratory rate is a fundamental vital sign that is sensitive to different pathological conditions (e.g., adverse cardiac events, pneumonia, and clinical deterioration) and stressors, including emotional stress, cognitive load, heat, cold, physical effort, and exercise-induced fatigue. The sensitivity of respiratory rate to these conditions is superior compared to that of most of the other vital signs, and the abundance of suitable technological solutions measuring respiratory rate has important implications for healthcare, occupational settings, and sport. However, respiratory rate is still too often not routinely monitored in these fields of use. This review presents a multidisciplinary approach to respiratory monitoring, with the aim to improve the development and efficacy of respiratory monitoring services. We have identified thirteen monitoring goals where the use of the respiratory rate is invaluable, and for each of them we have described suitable sensors and techniques to monitor respiratory rate in specific measurement scenarios. We have also provided a physiological rationale corroborating the importance of respiratory rate monitoring and an original multidisciplinary framework for the development of respiratory monitoring services. This review is expected to advance the field of respiratory monitoring and favor synergies between different disciplines to accomplish this goal.},

Second, we discuss in detail the synthetic-to-real domain adaptation problem that inevitably arises in applications of synthetic data, including synthetic-to-real refinement with GAN-based models and domain adaptation at the feature/model level without explicit data transformations. Third, we turn to privacy-related applications of synthetic data and review the work on generating synthetic datasets with differential privacy guarantees.

Effectively, a QAM symbol is repeated over multiple tones. Low density signature (LDS) is a version of CDMA with low density spreading sequence allowing us to take advantage of a near optimal ML receiver with practically feasible complexity. In this paper, we propose a new multiple access scheme so called sparse code multiple access (SCMA) which still enjoys the low complexity reception technique but with better performance compared to LDS. In SCMA, the procedure of bit to QAM symbol mapping and spreading are combined together and incoming bits are directly mapped to a multidimensional codeword of an SCMA codebook set. Each layer or user has its dedicated codebook. Shaping gain of a multidimensional constellation is the main source of the performance improvement in comparison to the simple repetition of QAM symbols in LDS. In general, SCMA codebook design is an optimization problem. A systematic sub-optimal approach is proposed here for SCMA codebook design.},

However, prior solutions such as X-ray diffraction and WiFi-based detection are not suitable for this purpose. X-ray-based methods usually require manual analysis or image processing algorithms with high complexity, while WiFi-based solutions may fail to detect complex structures due to the significant error of the RF-signal features. In this paper, we propose RF-Detector, a low-cost RFID solution for performing 3D structure detection of items contained in the packages, including the item orientations and relative locations. We thoroughly investigate a brand-new sensing model for RFID-based 3D structure detection, i.e., revolving scanning. We propose not only the fundamental revolving model but also a novel calibration method towards the undesired deployment. We have implemented a prototype system to evaluate the performance of RF-Detector. Extensive evaluations in real settings show the effectiveness of RF-Detector, achieving very high accuracy of the internal 3D structure detection.},

  abstract = {Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) represents an innovative paradigm for enhancing spectrum and hardware utilization for both sensing and communication. A specific type of ISAC, radar backscatter communication, involves low-power nodes embedding data onto radar signal reflections rather than generating new signals. However, existing radar backscatter techniques only facilitate uplink communication from the tag to the radar, neglecting downlink communication. This paper introduces BiScatter, an integrated radar backscatter communication and sensing system that enables simultaneous uplink and downlink backscatter communication, radar sensing, and backscatter localization. This is achieved through the design of chirp-slope-shift-keying modulation on top of Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radars, complemented by passive differential circuitry at the backscatter tags for low-power decoding. BiScatter also presents a packet structure compatible with off-the-shelf radars that offer accurate data processing and synchronization between radar and tag. We prototype this backscatter network in both 9GHz and 24GHz, demonstrating its capability to extend across different frequency bands. Our evaluations demonstrate that BiScatter supports two-way backscatter communication with BER lower than 10-3 up to 7m range and centimeter-level tag localization accuracy on top of off-the-shelf FMCW radars. The presented approach significantly augments the versatility and efficiency of ISAC for low-power devices.},

  abstract = {Although rainfall estimation employing microwave links from cellular telecommunication networks is recognized as a new promising measurement technique, its potential for long-term large-scale operational rainfall monitoring remains to be demonstrated. This study contributes to this endeavor by deriving a continuous series of rainfall maps from a large 2.5 year microwave link data set of, on average, 3383 links (2044 link paths) covering Netherlands ( 3.5 3 104 km2), a midlatitude country ( 58E,  528N) with a temperate climate. Maps are extensively verified against an independent gauge-adjusted radar rainfall data set for different temporal (15 min, 1 h, 1 day, 1 month) and spatial (0.9, 74 km2) scales. The usefulness of different steps in the rainfall retrieval algorithm, i.e., a wet-dry classification method and a filter to remove outliers, is systematically assessed. A novel dew filter is developed to correct for dew-induced wet antenna attenuation, which, although a relative underestimation of 6\% to 9\% is found, generally yields good results. The microwave link rainfall estimation technique performs well for the summer months (June, July, August), even outperforming interpolation of automatic rain gauge data (with a density of  1 gauge per 1000 km2), but large deviations are found for the winter months (December, January, February). These deviations are generally expected to be related to frozen or melting precipitation. Hence, our results show the potential of commercial microwave links for long-term large-scale operational rainfall monitoring.},

Five key themes emerged: inadequate verification approaches for both existing and emerging products; incomplete and uncertain observations; difficulties in accurately capturing users' real-world experiences using simplified metrics; poor communication and understanding of forecasts and complex verification information; and institutional factors such as limited resources, evolving meteorologist roles, and concerns over reputational damage. We identify nearly 50 operationally relevant scientific questions and suggest calls to action. Addressing these needs includes designing forecast systems with verification as a central consideration, enhancing the availability of observations, and developing and adopting community software systems. Additionally, we propose the establishment of an international community comprising environmental and social science researchers, statisticians, verification practitioners, and users to provide sustained support for this collective endeavor.},

More specifically, we propose Wiffract, a new foundation for imaging objects via edge tracing. Our approach uses the Geometrical Theory of Diffraction (GTD) and the corresponding Keller cones to image edges of the object. We extensively validate our approach with 37 experiments in three different areas, including through-wall scenarios. We take developing a WiFi Reader as one example application to showcase the capabilities of our proposed pipeline. More specifically, we show how our approach can successfully image several alphabet-shaped objects. We further show that our approach enables WiFi to read, i.e., correctly classify the letters, with an accuracy of 86.7\%. Finally, we show how our approach enables WiFi to image and read through walls, by imaging the details and further reading the letters of the word ``BELIEVE'' through walls. Overall, our proposed approach can open up new directions for RF imaging.},

In this work, we seek to propose a novel near-field communication protocol, MagneComm, which utilizes Magnetic Induction (MI) signals emitted from CPUs and captured by magnetometers on mobile devices for communication. Since CPUs and magnetometers are readily available components in mobile devices, MagneComm eliminates the requirement for special hardware and complements existing near-field communication protocols by providing additional bandwidth. We systematically analyze the characteristics of magnetic signals of CPUs and facilitate MagneComm with one-way communication, full-duplex communication, and multi-transmitter schemes in accordance with the hardware availability on devices. We prototype MagneComm on both laptops and smartphones. Extensive evaluation results show that MagneComm achieves up to 110bps within 10cm.},

Existing designs, however, consume significant power and computational resources, and hence cannot be run on low complexity, power constrained backscatter devices. This paper makes two main contributions: (1) we introduce the first multi-antenna cancellation design that operates on backscatter devices while retaining a small form factor and power footprint, (2) we introduce a novel coding mechanism that enables long range communication as well as concurrent transmissions and can be decoded on backscatter devices. We build hardware prototypes of the above designs that can be powered solely using harvested energy from TV and solar sources. The results show that our designs provide benefits for both RFID and ambient backscatter systems: they enable RFID tags to communicate directly with each other at distances of tens of meters and through multiple walls. They also increase the communication rate and range achieved by ambient backscatter systems by 100X and 40X respectively. We believe that this paper represents a substantial leap in the capabilities of backscatter communication.},

  abstract = {The computation demand for machine learning (ML) has grown rapidly recently, which comes with a number of costs. Estimating the energy cost helps measure its environmental impact and finding greener strategies, yet it is challenging without detailed information. We calculate the energy use and carbon footprint of several recent large models-T5, Meena, GShard, Switch Transformer, and GPT-3-and refine earlier estimates for the neural architecture search that found Evolved Transformer. We highlight the following opportunities to improve energy efficiency and CO2 equivalent emissions (CO2e): Large but sparsely activated DNNs can consume{$<$}1/10th the energy of large, dense DNNs without sacrificing accuracy despite using as many or even more parameters. Geographic location matters for ML workload scheduling since the fraction of carbon-free energy and resulting CO2e vary {\textasciitilde}5X-10X, even within the same country and the same organization. We are now optimizing where and when large models are trained. Specific datacenter infrastructure matters, as Cloud datacenters can be {\textasciitilde}1.4-2X more energy efficient than typical datacenters, and the ML-oriented accelerators inside them can be {\textasciitilde}2-5X more effective than off-the-shelf systems. Remarkably, the choice of DNN, datacenter, and processor can reduce the carbon footprint up to {\textasciitilde}100-1000X. These large factors also make retroactive estimates of energy cost difficult. To avoid miscalculations, we believe ML papers requiring large computational resources should make energy consumption and CO2e explicit when practical. We are working to be more transparent about energy use and CO2e in our future research. To help reduce the carbon footprint of ML, we believe energy usage and CO2e should be a key metric in evaluating models, and we are collaborating with MLPerf developers to include energy usage during training and inference in this industry standard benchmark.},

One of the main focus of halal research is halal certification and standard. The certification process involves verification of halal authenticity of the foods and adherence to Islamic principles. Despite the growing issuance of halal accreditation and efforts in uniting of halal certification, there are significant differences in determining the standard of halal accreditation and halal food regulation particularly between Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei and Malaysia, regardless of being neighbouring nations. Such instance is the variability of standards in determining the content of ethanol in the foods products. Thus, this review endeavours to study the standards in determining the permissible content of ethanol products and to investigate the reasons behind the contradiction in halal food regulation. Scope and approach The review is conducted through the literature regarding the dissimilarities of ethanol permissibility in halal dietary standard between the four countries, and at the same time, in-depth interviews with the corresponding from halal authorities in each country were also carried out. Key findings and conclusions Findings from the analysis suggest that authorities in those four countries differ their judgement based on these four factors; the material of preference for ethanol content; the technique of preference in ethanol detection laboratory; the undetermined constant in Blood Alcoholic Concentration calculation; and Islamic worldview on the usage of Alcohol. This review will be able to provide clarification and future references in constructing universal halal standard of ethanol content in the dietary product.},

  abstract = {In many circumstances, the conventional ultrasonic liquid-level detection presents the unreliable estimations due to the dynamically changed liquid level. In addition, there are circumstances where the level change involves not only the fluctuation but also the rise or fall of liquid level. To improve the measuring accuracy of liquid level using the ultrasonic method in dynamically changed level case, an attractive ultrasonic method, named the liquid-level detection based on the multiple-input multiple-output ultrasonic transducer array, is proposed in this paper. This method is different from the early ultrasonic liquid-level detections, including those that utilize transducer array. Based on the virtual element technology, the method employs the multitransducer array to achieve the reduction of system complexity and cost, and then applies the synthetic aperture technology to realize rapid samples of liquid level. Besides, one adaptive searching scheme of focused position in beamforming of synthetic aperture in each scanning direction is optimized to get the high precise samples of liquid level. The proposed method is verified by simulation and a real system, and compared with the conventional single-channel approach. We still proposed a simulation method of ultrasonic echo signal from liquid level based on the boundary-layer theory and the ultrasonic scattering theory. The simulated and actual measurement results demonstrate that the proposed method is obviously superior to the conventional approach. Meanwhile, the factors influencing on the proposed method are investigated by simulation also. The investigations reveal that the focus position in beamforming, the SNR of echo signal, and the wave size of liquid level have impact on the suggested method. However, it is indicated that the good performance of the proposed method remains, provided that the focus in beamforming is properly set in every scanning direction and the noise of echo signal is effectively controlled.},

  abstract = {Hand gesture recognition through wireless sensing is a new method of human-machine interaction, and is an important research direction for next generation integrated sensing and communication systems. Recently, although there are plenty of works on wireless sensing and hand gesture recognition, most of them are applied in single user scenario. Since the recognition algorithm is mainly realized by analyzing the variation of wireless propagation channel, the simultaneous movement of multiple people will cause superposition of the dynamic channel responses and cause interference to each other. This paper proposes to use spatial beamforming to alleviate the mutual influence of multiuser hand gestures. Since the hands of multiple users reflect the same signal, the channel responses are usually not orthogonal even if the users are well separated in different locations, and there is no reference signals to help distinguishing the channel response reflected by different users. We propose a preamble gesture scheme to estimate the spatial channel of dynamic reflections under the impact of strong phase noise, and use the Doppler variation feature to verify the channel response belongs to hand movement. We have a thorough analysis of the inter-user interference impacted by the transmitter-user-receiver geometry relations, user movement speeds and directions. The interference suppression effect is demonstrated by prototype experiments under real LOS and NLOS scenarios exploiting LTE signals.},

  abstract = {Solving Maxwell's equations is crucial in various fields, like electromagnetic scattering and antenna design optimization. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown powerful ability in solving PDEs. However, PINNs still struggle to solve Maxwell's equations in heterogeneous media due to a lack of knowledge of interface location and its physical attribution. To this end, we propose a domain-adaptive PINN (Da-PINN). First, we propose a parameter of media interface location to decompose the whole domain into several sub-domains with homogeneous media. Furthermore, the parameter of interface location and the electromagnetic interface conditions are incorporated into the loss function. Then, we propose a domain-adaptive training strategy for adaptively decomposing the domain and optimizing Da-PINN. Finally, the effectiveness of Da-PINN is verified with two case studies. The method can be used to solve problems in heterogeneous media with a lack of knowledge of interface location and its physical attribution.},

  abstract = {WiFi location systems are remarkably accurate, with decimeter-level errors for recent CSI-based systems. However, such high accuracy is achieved under Line-of-Sight (LOS) conditions and with an access point (AP) density that is much higher than that typically found in current deployments that primarily target good coverage. In contrast, when many of the APs within range are in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS), the location accuracy degrades drastically. In this paper we present UbiLocate, a WiFi location system that copes well with common AP deployment densities and works ubiquitously, i.e., without excessive degradation under NLOS. UbiLocate demonstrates that meter-level median accuracy NLOS localization is possible through (i) an innovative angle estimator based on a Nelder-Mead search, (ii) a fine-grained time of flight ranging system with nanosecond resolution, and (iii) the accuracy improvements brought about by the increase in bandwidth and number of antennas of IEEE 802.11ac. In combination, they provide superior resolvability of multipath components, significantly improving location accuracy over prior work. We implement our location system on off-the-shelf 802.11ac devices and make the implementation, CSI-extraction tool and custom Fine Timing Measurement design publicly available to the research community. We carry out an extensive performance analysis of our system and show that it outperforms current state-of-the-art location systems by a factor of 2--3, both under LOS and NLOS.},

  abstract = {Imagine a MIMO communication system that fully exploits the propagation characteristics offered by an electromagnetic channel and ultimately approaches the limits imposed by wireless communications. This is the concept of Holographic MIMO communications. Accurate and tractable channel modeling is critical to understanding its full potential. Classical stochastic models used by communications theorists are derived under the electromagnetic far-field assumption, i.e. planar wave approximation over the array. However, such assumption breaks down when electromagnetically large (compared to the wavelength) antenna arrays are considered. In this paper, we start from the first principles of wave propagation and provide a Fourier plane-wave series expansion of the channel response, which fully captures the essence of electromagnetic propagation in arbitrary scattering and is also valid in the (radiative) nearfield. The expansion is based on the Fourier spectral representation and has an intuitive physical interpretation, as it statistically describes the angular coupling between source and receiver. When discretized uniformly, it leads to a low-rank semi-unitarily equivalent approximation of the electromagnetic channel in the angular domain. The developed channel model is used to compute the ergodic capacity of a point-to-point Holographic MIMO system with different degrees of channel state information.},

  abstract = {The majority of stochastic channel models rely on the electromagnetic far-field assumption, which allows to decompose the channel in terms of plane waves. The far-field assumption breaks down in future applications that push towards the electromagnetic near-field region, such as those where the use of electromagnetically large antenna arrays is envisioned. Motivated by this consideration, we show how physical principles can be used to derive a plane-wave scalar channel model that is also valid in the reactive near-field region. Precisely, we show that narrowband wave propagation through a three-dimensional scattered medium can be generally modeled as a linear and space-variant system. We first review the physics principles that lead to a closed-form deterministic plane-wave representation of the channel impulse response. This serves as a basis for deriving a stochastic representation of the channel in terms of statistically independent Gaussian random coefficients for spatially stationary random propagation environments. The very desirable property of spatial stationarity can always be retained in the radiative near-field region by excluding reactive propagation mechanisms confined in close proximity to the source. Remarkably, the provided stochastic representation is directly connected to the Fourier spectral representation of a general stationary spatial random field.},

Given these physical constraints, the limit on the available number of spatial degrees of freedom is derived. The commonly used statistical multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) model is inadequate. Antenna theory is applied to take into account the area and geometry constraints, and to define the spatial signal space so as to interpret experimental channel measurements in an array-independent but manageable description of the physical environment. Based on these modeling strategies, for a spherical array of effective aperture A in a physical environment of angular spread {\textbar}/spl Omega/{\textbar} in solid angle, the number of spatial degrees of freedom is shown to be A{\textbar}/spl Omega/{\textbar} for uni-polarized antennas and 2A{\textbar}/spl Omega/{\textbar} for tri-polarized antennas. Together with the 2WT degrees of freedom for a system of bandwidth W transmitting in an interval T, the total degrees of freedom of a multiple-antenna channel is therefore 4WTA{\textbar}/spl Omega/{\textbar}.},

These vibrations are strong enough to propagate to the edge of the face and produce vibratory signals at an earphone. By re-tasking the earphone speaker as an input transducer - a software modification in the sound card - we are able to sense teeth-related gestures across various models of ear/headphones. In fact, by analyzing the signals at the two earphones, we show the feasibility of also localizing teeth gestures, resulting in a human-to-machine interface. Challenges range from coping with weak signals, distortions due to different teeth compositions, lack of timing resolution, spectral dispersion, etc. We address these problems with a sequence of sensing techniques, resulting in the ability to detect 6 distinct gestures in real-time. Results from 18 volunteers exhibit robustness, even though our system - EarSense - does not depend on per-user training. Importantly, EarSense also remains robust in the presence of concurrent user activities, like walking, nodding, cooking and cycling. Our ongoing work is focused on detecting teeth gestures even while music is being played in the earphone; once that problem is solved, we believe EarSense could be even more compelling.},

Recent location privacy preservation shows a strong personalized requirement from the mobile semantics between users and locations. However, the existing techniques cannot fully satisfy such personalized requirements, resulting in either overprotection or underprotection. It remains open to characterize and quantify the personalized requirement for location privacy preservation. In this article, we propose a mobile semantic-aware privacy model, named MSP. Specifically, we first characterize a new kind of user-related mobile semantic on-location set by constructing a hierarchical semantic tree, according to the user's roles at locations. Then, a dedicated approach is proposed to evaluate the location's privacy sensitivity and integrate it into the user-related mobile semantic. Finally, an adaptive privacy-preserving mechanism, MSP, is developed, fully considering the personalized requirement from both the user and the location. With this model in place, mobile semantic-aware synthetic trajectories are constructed adaptively. Extensive experiments with a real-world data set demonstrate that our MSP model can achieve an effective and flexible balance between the personalized privacy preservation and the data availability of synthetic trajectories.},

With the upcoming 5G New Radio (NR), FD-MIMO (Full Dimension MIMO) will play a major key role. FD-MIMO consists in arranging a large number of antennas in a 2D array, which enables to use 3D beamforming i.e., beamforming in both horizontal and vertical dimensions. The present paper provides a 3D beamforming model where beam steering depends on the random spatial distribution of users. We attempt to derive some analytical results regarding the probability distribution of antenna beamforming radiation pattern. Also, through system level simulations, we show how 3D beamforming can reduce interference impact, compared to the traditional 2D beamforming, and enhances system performance in terms of the coverage probability and users throughput.},

Conventionally, cavity waveguide perturbation, free-space transmission, open-ended coaxial probe, and planar transmission line technique have been used for characterizing materials. However, these planar transmission lines are often large and expensive to build, further restricting their use in many important applications. Thus, this technique is cost effective, easy to manufacture and due to its compact size, it has the potential to produce sensitivity and a high Q-factor for various materials. This paper reviews the common characteristics of planar transmission line and discusses numerous studies about several designs of the microstrip resonator to improve the sensor performance in terms of the sensitivity and accuracy. This technique enables its use for several industrial applications such as agriculture and quality control. It is believed that previous studies would lead to a promising solution of characterizing materials with high sensitivity, particularly in determining a high Qfactor resonator sensor.},

  abstract = {Machine-learning fluid flow                            Quantifying fluid flow is relevant to disciplines ranging from geophysics to medicine. Flow can be experimentally visualized using, for example, smoke or contrast agents, but extracting velocity and pressure fields from this information is tricky. Raissi               et al.               developed a machine-learning approach to tackle this problem. Their method exploits the knowledge of Navier-Stokes equations, which govern the dynamics of fluid flow in many scientifically relevant situations. The authors illustrate their approach using examples such as blood flow in an aneurysm.                                         Science               , this issue p.               1026                        ,              A machine learning approach exploiting the knowledge of Navier-Stokes equations can extract detailed fluid flow information.           ,              For centuries, flow visualization has been the art of making fluid motion visible in physical and biological systems. Although such flow patterns can be, in principle, described by the Navier-Stokes equations, extracting the velocity and pressure fields directly from the images is challenging. We addressed this problem by developing hidden fluid mechanics (HFM), a physics-informed deep-learning framework capable of encoding the Navier-Stokes equations into the neural networks while being agnostic to the geometry or the initial and boundary conditions. We demonstrate HFM for several physical and biomedical problems by extracting quantitative information for which direct measurements may not be possible. HFM is robust to low resolution and substantial noise in the observation data, which is important for potential applications.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a passive wireless RF sensor platform (RFSP), with only analog components, that harvests energy from an RF source and reflects data as a direct subcarrier modulation, thus making it battery free. A fully-analog architecture results in an ultra-low power device (under 200 {$\mu$}W) with a low component count, reducing the physical footprint. We envision such a platform to enable medical sensing systems that fit on a small bandaid like flexible structure, require no-battery, or charging and are able to provide continuous physiological monitoring. To realize this vision, we have developed and optimized a novel RF architecture that 1) directly maps sensor output to frequency modulation and transmits it to a remote receiver processing unit (RPU). This direct frequency mapping allows all further digitization and computation to be moved to the RPU -- reducing power and size requirements on the RFSP; 2) harvests energy from the carrier signal transmitted by a simple continuous wave transmitter, thereby requiring no batteries or supercap; and 3) uses backscatter to communicate with the RPU enabling ultra-low power requirements. The total power consumption of our prototype device leveraging this architecture was measured to be between 35 {$\mu$}W and 160 {$\mu$}W. We demonstrate that the RFSP can harvest sufficient power, sense, and communicate continuously without necessity for energy storage at a distance of 4 m from a transmitter emitting a 915 MHz continuous wave at 26 dBm (0.39 W). Prior backscatter systems typically have power budgets of 1 mW and require energy storage (battery or supercap), RFSP's sub 200 {$\mu$}W power consumption provides a significant improvement and longer range for a given TX power. To demonstrate applicability to real-world health sensing and the flexibility to adapt to different sensors, this paper presents results from breathing, heart rate, temperature, and sound sensing applications.},

Although past research attempts have achieved great success in data-driven PDE discovery, the robustness of the existing methods cannot be guaranteed when dealing with low-quality measurement data. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel physics-encoded discrete learning framework for discovering spatiotemporal PDEs from scarce and noisy data. The general idea is to (1) firstly introduce a novel deep convolutional-recurrent network, which can encode prior physics knowledge (e.g., known PDE terms, assumed PDE structure, initial/boundary conditions, etc.) while remaining flexible on representation capability, to accurately reconstruct high-fidelity data, and (2) perform sparse regression with the reconstructed data to identify the explicit form of the governing PDEs. We validate our method on three nonlinear PDE systems. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method over baseline models are demonstrated.},

Among those services, sensing the liquid level in a container is critical to building many smart home and mobile healthcare applications that improve the quality of life. This paper presents LiquidSense, a liquid level sensing system that is low-cost, high accuracy, widely applicable to different daily liquids and containers, and can be easily integrated with existing smart home networks. LiquidSense uses existing home WiFi network and a low-cost transducer that attached to the container to sense the resonance of the container for liquid level detection. In particular, our system mounts a low-cost transducer on the surface of the container and emits a well-designed chirp signal to make the container resonant, which introduces subtle changes to the home WiFi signals. By analyzing the subtle phase changes of the WiFi signals, LiquidSense extracts the resonance frequency as a feature for liquid level detection. Our system constructs prediction models for both continuous and discrete predictions using curve fitting and SVM respectively. We evaluate LiquidSense in home environments with containers of three different materials and six types of liquids. Results show that LiquidSense achieves an overall accuracy of 97\% for continuous prediction and an overall F-score of 0.968 for discrete predication. Results also show that our system has a large coverage in a home environment and works well under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios.},

  abstract = {Future wireless networks are expected to constitute a distributed intelligent wireless communications, sensing, and computing platform, which will have the challenging requirement of interconnecting the physical and digital worlds in a seamless and sustainable manner. Currently, two main factors prevent wireless network operators from building such networks: (1) the lack of control of the wireless environment, whose impact on the radio waves cannot be customized, and (2) the current operation of wireless radios, which consume a lot of power because new signals are generated whenever data has to be transmitted. In this paper, we challenge the usual ``more data needs more power and emission of radio waves'' status quo, and motivate that future wireless networks necessitate a smart radio environment: a transformative wireless concept, where the environmental objects are coated with artificial thin films of electromagnetic and reconfigurable material (that are referred to as reconfigurable intelligent meta-surfaces), which are capable of sensing the environment and of applying customized transformations to the radio waves. Smart radio environments have the potential to provide future wireless networks with uninterrupted wireless connectivity, and with the capability of transmitting data without generating new signals but recycling existing radio waves. We will discuss, in particular, two major types of reconfigurable intelligent meta-surfaces applied to wireless networks. The first type of meta-surfaces will be embedded into, e.g., walls, and will be directly controlled by the wireless network operators via a software controller in order to shape the radio waves for, e.g., improving the network coverage. The second type of meta-surfaces will be embedded into objects, e.g., smart t-shirts with sensors for health monitoring, and will backscatter the radio waves generated by cellular base stations in order to report their sensed data to mobile phones. These functionalities will enable wireless network operators to offer new services without the emission of additional radio waves, but by recycling those already existing for other purposes. This paper overviews the current research efforts on smart radio environments, the enabling technologies to realize them in practice, the need of new communication-theoretic models for their analysis and design, and the long-term and open research issues to be solved towards their massive deployment. In a nutshell, this paper is focused on discussing how the availability of reconfigurable intelligent meta-surfaces will allow wireless network operators to redesign common and well-known network communication paradigms.},

The technique is novel as phase information from the transmitted wave is not required to determine the complex permittivity. The textiles investigated are denim (cotton) and cow leather (two colours, red and beige). This method is shown to be simple to set up, easy to use and fast when compared with other methods such as free-wave reflectance and transmittance or Fabry--Perot cavity and gives results which are accurate enough for most of the practical applications. A significant difference in the absorption of mm-wave power between the two leather samples is observed. This can be explained by the different chemical composition of the two leather samples, investigated using a scanning electron microscope with electron dispersive spectrometry and which is almost certainly a result of the colouring process employed.},

The tag is designed to be integrated into small cavities carved out of metal objects to identify themselves during the entire fabrication and assembly line. Since the UHF RFID tag is applied just after the die casting operations needed to model the metal component, it must be robust to high temperature manufacturing environments and processes. Tests demonstrated a significant chip input impedance variation by increasing the surrounding temperature, with a consequent read-range reduction. However, the considered ceramic tag can be detected at a satisfactory distance of 30 cm when employed with temperatures so high as up to 120{\textopenbullet}C.},

  abstract = {Miniaturized liquid sensors are essential devices in online process or condition monitoring. In case of viscosity and density sensing, microacoustic sensors such as quartz crystal resonators or SAW devices have proved particularly useful. However, these devices basically measure a thin-film viscosity, which is often not comparable to the macroscopic parameters probed by conventional viscometers. Miniaturized cantilever-based devices are interesting alternatives for such applications, but here the interaction between the liquid and the oscillating beam is more involved. In our contribution, we describe a measurement setup, which allows the investigation of this interaction for different beam cross-sections. We present an analytical model based on an approximation of the immersed cantilever as an oscillating sphere comprising the effective mass and the intrinsic damping of the cantilever and additional mass and damping due to the liquid loading. The model parameters are obtained from measurements with well-known sample liquids by a curve fitting procedure. Finally, we present the measurement of viscosity and density of an unknown sample liquid, demonstrating the feasibility of the model.},

  abstract = {Radio-frequency components such as transmission lines are present in many defense systems such as radars, communication systems or electronic warfare systems. The conceptions of radio-frequency components involves a simulation phase that generally consists in the resolution of harmonic Maxwell's equations. Presently, these simulations are performed with mesh based methods such as finite element or finite difference methods. The results of a simulation is specific to a given geometry and mesh and can not be reemployed for a similar problem. The recently introduced physics informed neural networks (PINNs) could offer a mesh-free alternative to these methods. While PINNs for fluid mechanics has been tested multiple times, there are only few examples of PINNs for harmonic Maxwell equations in two dimension. In this paper we present a first attempt of training a PINN for the three dimensions simulation of a transmission line and we highlight the specific difficulties of training a PINN for radio-frequency simulations.},

The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

  abstract = {The recent innovation of frequency-shifted (FS) backscatter allows for backscattering with commodity devices, which are inherently half-duplex. However, their reliance on oscillators for generating the frequency-shifting signal on the tag, forces them to incur the transient phase of the oscillator before steady-state operation. We show how the oscillator's transient phase can pose a fundamental limitation for battery-less tags, resulting in significantly low bandwidth efficiencies, thereby limiting their practical usage. To this end, we propose a novel approach to FS-backscatter called xSHIFT that shifts the core functionality of FS away from the tag and onto the commodity device, thereby eliminating the need for on-tag oscillators altogether. The key innovation in xSHIFT lies in addressing the formidable challenges that arise in making this vision a reality. Specifically, xSHIFT's design is built on the construct of beating twin carrier tones through a non-linear device to generate the desired FS signal - while the twin RF carriers are generated externally through a careful embedding into the resource units of commodity WiFi transmissions, the beating is achieved through a carefully-designed passive tag circuitry. We prototype xSHIFT's tag, which is the same form factor as RFID Gen 2 tags, and characterize its promising real-world performance. We believe xSHIFT demonstrates one of the first, truly passive tag designs that has the potential to bring commodity backscatter to consumer spaces.},

It is versatile and simplifies calculation of waves scattered from a device. In the context of FDFD, the TF/SF formulation involves modifying all of the finite-difference equations that contain field terms from both the TF and SF regions in order to make the terms compatible. While simple in concept, modifying all of the equations for arbitrarily shaped TF/SF regions is tedious and no solution has been offered in the literature to do it in a straightforward manner. This paper presents a simple and efficient technique for implementing the TF/SF formulation that allows the TF/SF regions to be any shape and of arbitrary complexity. Its simplicity and versatility are demonstrated by giving several practical examples including a diffraction grating, a waveguide problem, and a scattering problem with a cylindrical wave source.},

So, millimeter-wave (mmWave) would exacerbate the device overheating problem in the future. In this work, we first perform a thermal characterization of mmWave devices: it reveals that after only 10 s. of data transfer at 1.9 Gbps, the antenna temperature reaches 68{$^\circ$}C; it reduces the link throughput by 21\%, increases the standard deviation by 6{\texttimes}, and takes 130 s. to dissipate the heat completely. We then propose Aquilo to bring temperature-awareness in mmWave networks; Aquilo maintains relatively high throughput performance and cools down the devices substantially. Our testbed experiments in static conditions show that Aquilo reaches a median peak temperature just 1{$^\circ$}C above the optimal with less than 10\% throughput sacrifice only.},

In this regard, we first identify the primary drivers of 6G systems, in terms of applications and accompanying technological trends. Then, we propose a new set of service classes and expose their target 6G performance requirements. We then identify the enabling technologies for the introduced 6G services and outline a comprehensive research agenda that leverages those technologies.

In GAS networks, where ground and aerial users share network resources, ubiquitous and accurate user localization becomes indispensable, not only as an end-user service but also as an enabler for location-aware communications. This breaks the convention of having localization as a byproduct in networks primarily designed for communications. To address these imperative localization needs, the design and utilization of ground, aerial, and space anchors require thorough investigation. In this tutorial, we provide an in-depth systemic analysis of the radio localization problem in GAS networks, considering ground and aerial users as targets to be localized. Starting from a survey of the most relevant works, we then define the key characteristics of anchors and targets in GAS networks. Subsequently, we detail localization fundamentals in GAS networks, considering 3D positions, orientations, and velocities. Afterward, we thoroughly analyze radio localization systems in GAS networks, detailing the system model, design aspects, and considerations for each of the three GAS anchors. Preliminary results are presented to provide a quantifiable perspective on key design aspects in GAS-based localization scenarios. We then identify the vital roles 6G enablers are expected to play in radio localization in GAS networks.},

The obtained results are in good agreement with the literature data, which are, however, often available only at discrete frequencies, thus making it difficult to recognize dispersive properties of the measured samples. It is shown in this paper that broadband measurement of high-resistivity and intrinsic silicon allows extracting their resistivity solely due to conduction losses. In the case of typical electronic substrates, it is shown that their dielectric constant is almost non-dispersive, whereas losses are, in general, linearly increasing with frequency. Glasses also exhibit almost non-dispersive dielectric constant, which is, however, larger than 3.8, whereas their losses can vary by over two orders of magnitude depending on the properties, like the hydroxyl content. The lowest dielectric constant is easily achievable in common plastics, spanning from ca. 2.03 for Teflon up to ca. 3.0 for PETG.},

  abstract = {Accurate and tractable channel modeling is critical to realizing the full potential of antenna arrays in wireless communications. Current approaches represent two extremes: idealized statistical models representing a rich scattering environment and parameterized physical models that describe realistic scattering environments via the angles and gains associated with different propagation paths. However, simple rules that capture the effects of scattering characteristics on channel capacity and diversity are difficult to infer from existing models. We propose an intermediate virtual channel representation that captures the essence of physical modeling and provides a simple geometric interpretation of the scattering environment. The virtual representation corresponds to a fixed coordinate transformation via spatial basis functions defined by fixed virtual angles. We show that in an uncorrelated scattering environment, the elements of the channel matrix form a segment of a stationary process and that the virtual channel coefficients are approximately uncorrelated samples of the underlying spectral representation. For any scattering environment, the virtual channel matrix clearly reveals the two key factors affecting capacity: the number of parallel channels and the level of diversity. The concepts of spatial zooming and aliasing are introduced to provide a transparent interpretation of the effect of antenna spacing on channel statistics and capacity. Numerical results are presented to illustrate various aspects of the virtual framework.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates a context-adaptive sample acquisition strategy at sub-Nyquist sampling rate for wearable embedded sensor devices. Our approach can be applied to compressive sensing frameworks to minimise sampling and transmission costs. We consider a context estimate to represent the local signal structure and a feed-forward response model to continuously tune signal acquisition of an online sampling and transmission system. To evaluate our approach, we analysed the performance in different pattern recognition scenarios. We report three case studies here: (1) eating monitoring based on electromyography measurements in smart eyeglasses, (2) human activity recognition based on waist-worn inertial sensor data, and (3) heartbeat detection and arrhythmia classification based on single-lead electrocardiogram readings. Compared to conventional sub-Nyquist sampling, our context-adaptive approach saves between 13 to 22 percent of energy, while achieving similar pattern recognition performance and reconstruction error.},

Specifically, this sensor self-tunes between 902 and 928 MHz, operating in the RFID UHF band, as the temperature rises or falls beyond a certain threshold. The novelty of this passive sensor is its ability to operate through multiple high-/low-temperature cycles. The design consists of a planar dipole antenna with a customized integrated T-match network (ITMN) that is actuated above a ground plane. The actuation shifts the operating frequency and is controlled by liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs), which are programmable and reversible temperature-dependent polymers. As a result, our design can be reconfigured to operate at various temperature ranges for which the LCE is designed to operate. The analysis is performed to examine the performance of the proposed sensor near practical items and when it is in close-proximity to an additional sensor with varying orientation. Finally, the sensor's performance was validated through full-wave simulations using ANSYS HFSS and measurements. Both the simulation and measurements agreed well with theory.},

In particular, RFVibe plays an audio sound next to the object that generates micro-vibrations in the object. These micro-vibrations can be captured by shining a millimeter wave radar signal on the object and analyzing the phase of the reflected wireless signal. RFVibe can then extract several features including resonance frequencies and vibration modes, damping time of vibrations, and wireless reflection coefficients. These features are then used to enable more accurate identification, with a step towards generalizing towards different setups and locations. We implement RFVibe using an off-the-shelf millimeter-wave radar and an acoustic speaker. We evaluate it on 23 objects of 7 material types (Metal, Wood, Ceramic, Glass, Plastic, Cardboard, and Foam), obtaining 81.3\% accuracy for material classification, a 30\% improvement over prior work. RFVibe is able to classify with reasonable accuracy in scenarios that it has not encountered before, including different locations, angles, boundary conditions, and objects.},

In tackling the unknown heights of solution and antenna, we devise the electric field distribution model at the receiving antenna, solving the unknown heights via spatio-differential model. Among eight different solvents, LiqRay can identify alcohol solutions with a concentration difference of 1\% with 94.92\% accuracy. Nevertheless, LiqRay can obtain the relative frequency response factor with a relative error of 6.7\% without being affected by the height of the solution. Even if it is merely 4 cm, this is fairly lower than that of most antennas' heights, since the operating frequency is around 2 GHz.},

Online clothing stores are capable capturing customer shopping behavior by analyzing the click stream and customer shopping carts. Retailers with physical clothing stores, however, still lack effective methods to identify comprehensive shopping behaviors. In this paper, we show that backscatter signals of passive RFID tags can be exploited to detect and record how customers browse stores, which items of clothes they pay attention to, and which items of clothes they usually match with. The intuition is that the phase readings of tags attached on desired items will demonstrate distinct yet stable patterns in the time-series when customers look at, pick up or turn over desired items. We design ShopMiner,, a framework that harnesses these unique spatial-temporal correlations of time-series phase readings to detect comprehensive shopping behaviors. We have implemented a prototype of ShopMiner, with a COTS RFID reader and four antennas, and tested its effectiveness in two typical indoor environments. Empirical studies from two-week shopping-like data show that ShopMiner, could achieve high accuracy and efficiency in customer shopping behavior identification.},

  abstract = {Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is gradually becoming a reality due to the significant increase in frequency and bandwidth of next-generation wireless communication technologies. Therefore it becomes crucial to evaluate the communication and sensing performance using appropriate channel models to address resource competition from each other. Existing work only models the sensing capability based on the mutual information between the channel response and the received signal, and its theoretical resolution is difficult to support the high-precision requirements of ISAC for sensing tasks, and may even affect its communication optimal. In this paper, we propose a sensing channel encoder model to measure the sensing capacity with higher resolution by discrete task mutual information. For the first time, derive upper and lower bounds on the sensing accuracy for a given channel. This model not only provides the possibility of optimizing the ISAC systems at a finer granularity and balancing communication and sensing resources, but also provides theoretical explanations for classical intuitive feelings (like more modalities more accuracy) in wireless sensing. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed channel model through real-case studies, including person identification, displacement detection, direction estimation, and device recognition. The evaluation results indicate a Pearson correlation coefficient exceeding 0.9 between our task mutual information and conventional experimental metrics (e.g., accuracy).},

Based on commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) WiFi devices, this paper proposes LiquImager, which can simultaneously identify liquid and image container regardless of container shape and position. Since the container size is close to the wavelength, diffraction makes the effect of the liquid on the signal difficult to approximate with a simple geometric model (such as ray tracking). Based on Maxwell's equations, we construct an electric field scattering sensing model. Using few measurements provided by COTS WiFi devices, we solve the scattering model to obtain the medium distribution of the sensing domain, which is used for identifing and imaging liquids. To suppress the signal noise, we propose LiqU-Net for image enhancement. For the centimeter-scale container that is randomly placed in an area of 25 cm {\texttimes} 25 cm, LiquImager can identify the liquid more than 90\% accuracy. In terms of container imaging, LiquImager can accurately find the edge of the container for 4 types of containers with a volume less than 500 ml.},

While contact-based~(a tag is attached to the target of interest) sensing has achieved promising results, contactless sensing still faces severe challenges such as low accuracy and inability to sense multiple targets simultaneously in proximity, restricting its applicability in real-world deployment. In this work, we present               Tamera               , a contactless RFID-based sensing system, which significantly improves the tracking accuracy, enables multi-commodity tracking, and even material and shopping behavior recognition.

BEAVIS has built-in rotor fault detection and tolerance. We explain the design and the necessary background in detail. We verify the dynamics of BEAVIS and demonstrate its distinct advantages, such as agility, over existing platforms including the degrees of freedom akin to a drone with 11.36{\texttimes} increased lifetime. We exemplify the potential of BEAVIS to become an invaluable platform for many applications.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the effect of heavy rainfall on the propagation of a 38-GHz in a tropical region was studied and analyzed. Real measurement was collected, with a path length of 300 meters, for a (5G) radio linkage in Malaysia, installed at the Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) Johor Bahru campus. The employed system entails an Ericsson MINI-Link 38 E-0.6 mm, with a horizontal polarization (HP) antenna at the top integrated with a rain gauge and a data logger. Daily registered samples with a single minute span, for a full study period of 1 month, were collected and evaluated. The obtained rain rate was found as 56 mm/hr with a specific rain attenuation of 18.4 dB/km for 0.01\% of the time. In addition to that, a calculated average rain attenuation of 5.5 dB for the transmission path of 300 meters length, was calculated. Based on these findings, a recommendation to update the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) specification of the rain attenuation for Malaysia is proposed. Based on the results, we suggest shifting the zone classification of Malaysia from zone P to zone N-P. Therefore, accurate design for future 5G systems would rely on more precise estimated attenuation levels leading to enhanced performance.},

Applications of these techniques are in indoor localization, gesture recognition, inventory tracking, vehicular motion, and many others. This paper identifies room for improvement over today's motion tracking techniques. The core observation is that conventional systems have trusted gravity more than the magnetic North to infer the 3D orientation of the object. We find that the reverse is more effective, especially when the object is in continuous fast motion. We leverage this opportunity to design MUSE, a magnetometer-centric sensor fusion algorithm for orientation tracking. Moreover, when the object's motion is somewhat restricted (e.g., human-arm motion restricted by elbow and shoulder joints), we find new methods of sensor fusion to fully leverage the restrictions. Real experiments across a wide range of uncontrolled scenarios show consistent improvement in orientation and location accuracy, without requiring any training or machine learning. We believe this is an important progress in the otherwise mature field of IMU-based motion tracking.},

  abstract = {Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) systems are widely used to obtain fingerprint spectra of many different biomedical substances, and thus the identification of different biological materials, medicines, or dangerous chemicals can be realized. However, the spectral data for the same substance obtained from different THz-TDS systems may have distinct differences because of differences in system errors and data processing methods, which leads to misclassification and errors in identification. To realize the exact and fast identification of substances, spectral standardization is the key issue. In this paper, we present detailed disposal methods and execution processes for the spectral standardization and substance identification, including feature extracting, database searching, and fingerprint spectrum matching of unknown substances. Here, we take twelve biomedical compounds including different biological materials, medicines, or dangerous chemicals as examples. These compounds were analyzed by two different THz-TDS systems, one of which is a commercial product and the other is our verification platform. The original spectra from two systems showed obvious differences in their curve shapes and amplitudes. After wavelet transform, cubic spline interpolation, and support vector machine (SVM) classification with an appropriate kernel function, the spectra from two systems can be standardized, and the recognition rate of qualitative identification can be up to 99.17\%.},

  abstract = {This paper considers device-free sensing in an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) cellular network to enable integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). A novel two-phase sensing framework is proposed to localize the passive targets that cannot transmit/receive reference signals to/from the base stations (BSs), where the ranges of the targets are estimated based on their reflected OFDM signals to the BSs in Phase I, and the location of each target is estimated based on its ranges to different BSs in Phase II. Specifically, in Phase I, we design a model-free range estimation approach by leveraging the OFDM channel estimation technique for determining the delay values of all the two-way BS-target-BS paths, which does not rely on any BS-target channel model. In Phase II, we reveal that ghost targets may be falsely detected in some cases as all the targets reflect the same signals to the BSs, which thus do not know how to match each estimated range with the right target. Interestingly, we show that the above data association issue is not a fundamental limitation for device-free sensing: under the ideal case of perfect range estimation in Phase I, the probability for ghost targets to exist is proved to be negligible when the targets are randomly located. Moreover, under the practical case of imperfect range estimation in Phase I, we propose an efficient algorithm for joint data association and target localization in Phase II. Numerical results show that our proposed two-phase framework can achieve very high accuracy in the localization of passive targets, which increases with the system bandwidth.},

We consider an active shape model, where ---for an object category--- we are given a library of potential CAD models describing objects in that category, and we adopt a standard formulation where pose and shape estimation are formulated as a non-convex optimization. Our first contribution is to provide the first certifiably optimal solver for pose and shape estimation. In particular, we show that rotation estimation can be decoupled from the estimation of the object translation and shape, and we demonstrate that (i) the optimal object rotation can be computed via a tight (small-size) semidefinite relaxation, and (ii) the translation and shape parameters can be computed in closed-form given the rotation. Our second contribution is to add an outlier rejection layer to our solver, hence making it robust to a large number of misdetections. Towards this goal, we wrap our optimal solver in a robust estimation scheme based on graduated non-convexity. To further enhance robustness to outliers, we also develop the first graph-theoretic formulation to prune outliers in category-level perception, which removes outliers via convex hull and maximum clique computations; the resulting approach is robust to 70 - 90\% outliers. Our third contribution is an extensive experimental evaluation. Besides providing an ablation study on a simulated dataset and on the PASCAL3D+ dataset, we combine our solver with a deep-learned keypoint detector, and show that the resulting approach improves over the state of the art in vehicle pose estimation in the ApolloScape datasets.},

Owing to the existence of this e-quantity, it also possesses similar long-time behavior to the Cucker-Smale model in 1D [19]. The utility of the s-model is that it also has the versatility to behave qualitatively like the Motsch-Tadmor model, for which global regularity theory is not known.},

In this paper, we report the space-to-Earth communication bottlenecks derived from our experience of deploying an IoT satellite. Specifically, we characterize the challenges posed by the low link budgets, satellite motion, and packet collisions. To address these challenges, we design a new class of techniques that use the Doppler shift caused by the satellite's motion as a unique signature for packet detection and decoding, even at low signal-to-noise ratios and in the presence of collisions. We integrate these techniques into our system, called Spectrumize, and evaluate its performance through both simulations and real-world deployments. Our evaluation shows that Spectrumize performs 3{\texttimes} better compared to the classic approach in detecting packets with over 80\% average accuracy in decoding.},

While custom localization technologies (e.g RFID) have the potential to support low-cost battery-free tag tracking, the cost and complexity of commissioning a space with beacons or readers has stifled adoption. In this paper, we explore how WiFi backscatter localization can be realized using the existing WiFi infrastructure already deployed for data applications. We present a new approach that leverages existing WiFi infrastructure to enable extremely low-power and accurate tag localization relative to a single scanning device. First, we adopt an ultra-low power tag design in which the tag blindly modulates ongoing WiFi packets using On-Off Keying (OOK). Then, we utilize the underlying physical properties of multipath propagation to detect the passive wireless reflection from the tag in the presence of rich multipath propagations. Finally, we localize the tag from a single receiver by forming a triangle between the tag reflection and the LoS path between the two WiFi transceivers. We implement TagFi using a customized backscatter tag and off-the-shelf WiFi chipsets. Our empirical results in a cluttered office building demonstrate that TagFi achieves a median localization accuracy of 0.2m up to 8 meters range.},

  abstract = {Voxel and point representations are widely applied in recent 3D object detection tasks from LiDAR point clouds. Voxel representations contribute to efficiently and rapidly locating objects, whereas point representations are capable of describing intra-object spatial relationship for detection refinement. In this work, we aim to exploit the strengths of both two representations, and present a novel two-stage detector, named Joint Point-Voxel Network (JPV-Net). Specifically, our framework is equipped with a Dual Encoders-Fusion Decoder, which consists of the dual encoders to extract voxel features of sketchy 3D scenes and point features rich in geometric context, respectively, and the Feature Propagation Fusion (FP-Fusion) decoder to attentively fuse them from coarse to fine. By making use of the advantages of these features, the refinement network can effectively eliminate false detection and provide better accuracy. Besides, to further develop the perception characteristics of voxel CNN and point backbone, we design two novel intersection-over-union (IoU) estimation modules for proposal generation and refinement, both of which can alleviate the misalignment between the localization and the classification confidence. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset and ONCE dataset demonstrate that our proposed JPV-Net outperforms other state-of-the-art methods with remarkable margins.},

The operators of those networks commonly have access to detailed traffic profiles and performance goals, which they seek to meet as efficiently as possible. Of interest are solutions for offering latency guarantees while minimizing the required network bandwidth. Of particular interest is the extent to which traffic (re)shaping can be of benefit. The paper focuses on the most basic network configuration, namely, a single node, single link network, with extensions to more general, multi-node networks discussed in a companion paper. The main results are in the form of optimal solutions for different types of schedulers of varying complexity, and therefore cost. The results demonstrate how judicious traffic shaping can help lower complexity schedulers reduce the bandwidth they require, often performing as well as more complex ones.},

  abstract = {The major obstacle for learning-based RF sensing is to obtain a high-quality large-scale annotated dataset. However, unlike visual datasets that can be easily annotated by human workers, RF signal is non-intuitive and non-interpretable, which causes the annotation of RF signals time-consuming and laborious. To resolve the rapacious appetite of annotated data, we propose a novel unsupervised representation learning (URL) framework for RF sensing, RF-URL, to learn a pre-training model on large-scale unannotated RF datasets that can be easily collected. RF-URL utilizes a contrastive framework to mind the gap between signal-processing-based RF sensing and learning-based RF sensing. By constructing positive and negative pairs through different signal processing representations, RF-URL seamlessly integrates the existing RF signal processing algorithms into the learning-based networks. Moreover, the RF-URL is carefully designed to take into account the asymmetric characteristics of different RF signal processing representations. We show that RF-URL is universal to a variety of RF sensing tasks by evaluating RF-URL in three typical RF sensing tasks (human gesture recognition, 3D pose estimation and silhouette generation) based on two general RF devices (WiFi and radar). All experimental results strongly demonstrate that RF-URL takes an important step towards learning-based solutions for large-scale RF sensing applications.},

We argue that the optimizer would deal with an easier learning task when the feature maps from the decoder and encoder networks are semantically similar. We have evaluated UNet++ in comparison with U-Net and wide U-Net architectures across multiple medical image segmentation tasks: nodule segmentation in the low-dose CT scans of chest, nuclei segmentation in the microscopy images, liver segmentation in abdominal CT scans, and polyp segmentation in colonoscopy videos. Our experiments demonstrate that UNet++ with deep supervision achieves an average IoU gain of 3.9 and 3.4 points over U-Net and wide U-Net, respectively.},

The main advantages of this formulation are that it leads to a simple optimization problem for discretized curves, and that it provides a flexible approach to deal with noisy, inconsistent or corrupted data. These benefits are illustrated via a few preliminary numerical results.},

  abstract = {We characterize the exact solutions to neural network descrambling--a mathematical model for explaining the fully connected layers of trained neural networks (NNs). By reformulating the problem to the minimization of the Brockett function arising in graph matching and complexity theory we show that the principal components of the hidden layer preactivations can be characterized as the optimal ``explainers'' or descramblers for the layer weights, leading to descrambled weight matrices. We show that in typical deep learning contexts these descramblers take diverse and interesting forms including (1) matching largest principal components with the lowest frequency modes of the Fourier basis for isotropic hidden data, (2) discovering the semantic development in two-layer linear NNs for signal recovery problems, and (3) explaining CNNs by optimally permuting the neurons. Our numerical experiments indicate that the eigendecompositions of the hidden layer data--now understood as the descramblers--can also reveal the layer's underlying transformation. These results illustrate that the SVD is more directly related to the explainability of NNs than previously thought and offers a promising avenue for discovering interpretable motifs for the hidden action of NNs, especially in contexts of operator learning or physicsinformed NNs, where the input/output data has limited human readability.},

In this paper, we propose a simple but effective online crop-and-paste data augmentation pipeline for structured 3D point cloud scenes, named CorrelaBoost. Observing that 3D objects should have reasonable relative positions in a structured scene because of the objects' functionalities and natural relationships, we express this correlation as a kind of interactive force. An energy field called Correlation Field can be calculated correspondingly across the whole 3D space. According to the Correlation Field, we propose two data augmentation strategies to explore highly congruent positions that a designated object may be pasted to: 1) Category Consistent Exchanging and 2) Energy Optimized Transformation. We conduct exhaustive experiments on various popular benchmarks with different detection frameworks and the results illustrate that our method brings huge free-lunch improvement and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of data augmentation. It is worth noting that the performance of VoteNet with mAP@0.5 is improved by 7.7 on ScanNetV2 dataset and 5.0 on SUN RGB-D dataset.

Exacerbating the problem, the counterfeits are packaged and sealed to factory standards, rendering it extremely difficult for an average consumer to identify them. While solutions exist, they are often impractical for the general public as they require specialized and costly equipment. To overcome these limitations, we propose LiquidHash, a novel counterfeit liquid food product detection system. LiquidHash is a practical solution that only requires the use of a commodity smartphone to detect adulterated liquid products without opening the bottles. LiquidHash works by detecting and tracking the shape and movement of air bubbles that form inside the bottles. We implement LiquidHash and evaluate its feasibility with real-world experiments under varying conditions with a total of more than 500 minutes of video recording and observe an overall detection accuracy of up to 95\%.},

  abstract = {Dynamical systems are typically governed by a set of linear/nonlinear differential equations. Distilling the analytical form of these equations from very limited data remains intractable in many disciplines such as physics, biology, climate science, engineering and social science. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose a novel Physics-informed Spline Learning (PiSL) framework to discover parsimonious governing equations for nonlinear dynamics, based on sparsely sampled noisy data. The key concept is to (1) leverage splines to interpolate locally the dynamics, perform analytical differentiation and build the library of candidate terms, (2) employ sparse representation of the governing equations, and (3) use the physics residual in turn to inform the spline learning. The synergy between splines and discovered underlying physics leads to the robust capacity of dealing with high-level data scarcity and noise. A hybrid sparsity-promoting alternating direction optimization strategy is developed for systematically pruning the sparse coefficients that form the structure and explicit expression of the governing equations. The efficacy and superiority of the proposed method have been demonstrated by multiple well-known nonlinear dynamical systems, in comparison with two state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {Robust speech enhancement is considered as the holy grail of audio processing and a key requirement for human-human and human-machine interaction. Solving this task with single-channel, audio-only methods remains an open challenge, especially for practical scenarios involving a mixture of competing speakers and background noise. In this paper, we propose UltraSE, which uses ultrasound sensing as a complementary modality to separate the desired speaker's voice from interferences and noise. UltraSE uses a commodity mobile device (e.g., smartphone) to emit ultrasound and capture the reflections from the speaker's articulatory gestures. It introduces a multi-modal, multi-domain deep learning framework to fuse the ultrasonic Doppler features and the audible speech spectrogram. Furthermore, it employs an adversarially trained discriminator, based on a cross-modal similarity measurement network, to learn the correlation between the two heterogeneous feature modalities. Our experiments verify that UltraSE simultaneously improves speech intelligibility and quality, and outperforms state-of-the-art solutions by a large margin.},

Investigated celluloses were: bacterial celluloses cultured in presence of pectin and/or xyloglucan, as well as commercial celluloses and cellulose extracted from apple parenchyma. FT-IR spectra were used to estimate of the I{$\beta$} content, whereas Raman spectra were used to evaluate the degree of crystallinity of the cellulose. The crystallinity index (XCRAMAN\%) varied from -25\% for apple cellulose to 53\% for microcrystalline commercial cellulose. Considering bacterial cellulose, addition of xyloglucan has an impact on the percentage content of cellulose I{$\beta$}. However, addition of only xyloglucan or only pectins to pure bacterial cellulose both resulted in a slight decrease of crystallinity. However, culturing bacterial cellulose in the presence of mixtures of xyloglucan and pectins results in an increase of crystallinity. The results confirmed that the higher degree of crystallinity, the broader the peak around 913 cm-1. Among all bacterial celluloses the bacterial cellulose cultured in presence of xyloglucan and pectin (BCPX) has the most similar structure to those observed in natural primary cell walls.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the basis and applications of the finite-difference time -domain (FD-TD) numerical modeling approach for Maxwell's equations. FD-TD is very simple in concept and execution. However, it is remarkably robust, providing highly accurate modeling predictions for a wide variety of electromagnetic wave interaction problems. The accuracy and breadth of FD-TD applications will be illustrated by a number of two- and three-dimensional examples. The objects modeled range in nature from simple geometric shapes to extremely complex aerospace and biological systems. In all cases where rigorous analytical, code-to-code, or experimental validations are possible, FD-TD predictive data for penetrating and scattered near fields as well as radar cross sections are in excellent agreement with the benchmarks. It will also be shown that opportunities are arising in applying FD-TD to model rapidly time-varying systems, microwave circuits, and inverse scattering. With continuing advances in FD-TD modeling theory as well as continuing advances in supercomputer technology, there is a strong possibility that FD-TD numerical modeling will occupy an important place in high-frequency engineering electromagnetics as we move into the 1990s.},

  abstract = {The vision of embedding connectivity into billions of everyday objects runs into the reality of existing communication technologies -- there is no existing wireless technology that can provide reliable and long-range communication at tens of microwatts of power as well as cost less than a dime. While backscatter is low-power and low-cost, it is known to be limited to short ranges. This paper overturns this conventional wisdom about backscatter and presents the first wide-area backscatter system. Our design can successfully backscatter from any location between an RF source and receiver, separated by 475 m, while being compatible with commodity LoRa hardware. Further, when our backscatter device is co-located with the RF source, the receiver can be as far as 2.8 km away. We deploy our system in a 4,800 ft2 (446 m2) house spread across three floors, a 13,024 ft2 (1210 m2) office area covering 41 rooms, as well as a one-acre (4046 m2) vegetable farm and show that we can achieve reliable coverage, using only a single RF source and receiver. We also build a contact lens prototype as well as a flexible epidermal patch device attached to the human skin. We show that these devices can reliably backscatter data across a 3,328 ft2 (309 m2) room. Finally, we present a design sketch of a LoRa backscatter IC that shows that it costs less than a dime at scale and consumes only 9.25 {$\mu$}W of power, which is more than 1000x lower power than LoRa radio chipsets.},

Its power management unit operates over a large temperature range using a zero temperature coefficient bias source. On-chip temperature sensing is accomplished with low-voltage, low-power CMOS circuitry, and time-domain signal processing. Two readout commands have been defined to study supply noise sensitivity: 1) standard readout, where just a single set of data is transferred to the reader and 2) serial readout, where several sets of data are sent one after the other to the reader. With the standard readout command, the sensor suffers from interference from the RFID command packet and outputs interference as well, while the sensor outputs no interference with the serial readout command. Measurements show that sensor resolution with serial readout is improved by a factor of approximately 16 compared to standard readout. The chip was fabricated in a standard 0.35-{$\mu$}m CMOS technology and chip-on-board mounted to a tuned RFID transponder coil on an aluminum core FR4 PCB substrate. Real-time wireless temperature sensing has been demonstrated with a commercial HF RFID reader. With a two-point calibration, the SoC achieves a 3{$\sigma$} sensing accuracy of {\textpm}0.4 {$^\circ$}C from 0 {$^\circ$}C to 125 {$^\circ$}C.},

Such a system can enable easy and large-scale deployment for multi-user tracking and sensing without the need for additional sensors through the use of existing WiFi devices (e.g., desktops, laptops and smart appliances). The basic idea is to identify and extract the signal reflection corresponding to each individual user with the help of multiple WiFi links and all the available WiFi channels at 5GHz. Given the extracted signal reflection of each user, MultiTrack examines the path of the reflected signals at multiple links to simultaneously track multiple users. It further reconstructs the signal profile of each user as if only a single user has performed activity in the environment to facilitate multi-user activity recognition. We evaluate MultiTrack in different multipath environments with up to 4 users for multi-user tracking and up to 3 users for activity recognition. Experimental results show that our system can achieve decimeter localization accuracy and over 92\% activity recognition accuracy under multi-user scenarios.},

Recently, a new non-contact skin infrared thermometer for children was introduced in the market with excellent acceptance by parents.                                         Methods{$\quad$}               A prospective, analytical, cross-sectional study was designed in order to assess the effectiveness of the infrared non-contact thermometer (Thermofocus) in comparison with two other known methods used to measure body temperature. Children aged 1 to 48 months were included from the emergency room and inpatient unit. All patients selected were assessed with three different thermometers: (1) non-contact infrared thermometer (Thermofocus); (2) temporal artery thermometer (Exergen); and (3) rectal glass mercury thermometer.                                         Results{$\quad$}               Four hundred and thirty-four patients were eligible to complete the study. One hundred and sixty-seven were identified with fever. The mean age of the patients studied was 14.6 {\textpm} 10.7 months. Both devices were strongly correlated with the rectal temperature:               r               = 0.950 for Exergen and               r               = 0.952 for Thermofocus. The mean difference in temperature between the rectal temperature and the non-contact thermometer was 0.029 {\textpm} 0.01{$^\circ$}C (               P               {$<$} 0.001), while the mean difference between the temporal artery thermometer and the rectal temperature was -0.20 {\textpm} 0.27{$^\circ$}C (               P               {$<$} 0.001). The sensitivity and specificity for the non-contact thermometer is 97\%. The negative predictive value is 99\%, which is especially important to rule out fever and avoid unnecessary laboratory work-up.                                         Conclusions{$\quad$}               The non-contact infrared thermometer is a reliable, comfortable and accurate option for measurement of temperature and is very useful for the screening of fever in the paediatric population. More studies are recommended to support the evidence found in this study and compare its accuracy with more complex devices.},

However, it is a tough task to reassemble severely broken oracle bone rubbings because of detail loss in manual labeling, the great time consumption of rejoining, and the low accuracy of results. To overcome the challenges, we introduce a novel CFDA\&CAP algorithm that consists of the Curve Fitting Degree Analysis (CFDA) algorithm and the Correlation Analysis of Pearson (CAP) algorithm. First, the orthogonalization system is constructed to extract local features based on the curve features analysis. Second, the global feature descriptor is depicted by using coordinate points sequences. Third, we screen candidate curves based on the features as well as the CFDA algorithm, so the search range of the candidates is narrowed down. Finally, image recommendation libraries for target curves are generated by adopting the CAP algorithm, and the rank for each target matching curve generates simultaneously for result evaluation. With experiments, the proposed method shows a good effect in rejoining oracle bone rubbings automatically: (1) it improves the average accuracy rate of curve matching up to 84\%, and (2) for a low-resource task, the accuracy of our method has 25\% higher accuracy than that of other methods.},

  abstract = {Falls are the top reason for fatal and non-fatal injuries among seniors. Existing solutions are based on wearable fall-alert sensors, but medical research has shown that they are ineffective, mostly because seniors do not wear them. These revelations have led to new passive sensors that infer falls by analyzing Radio Frequency (RF) signals in homes. Seniors can go about their lives as usual without the need to wear any device. While passive monitoring has made major advances, current approaches still cannot deal with the complexities of real-world scenarios. They typically train and test their classifiers on the same people in the same environments, and cannot generalize to new people or new environments. Further, they cannot separate motions from different people and can easily miss a fall in the presence of other motions.             To overcome these limitations, we introduce Aryokee, an RF-based fall detection system that uses convolutional neural networks governed by a state machine. Aryokee works with new people and environments unseen in the training set. It also separates different sources of motion to increase robustness. Results from testing Aryokee with over 140 people performing 40 types of activities in 57 different environments show a recall of 94\% and a precision of 92\% in detecting falls.},

  abstract = {It has been observed that super resolution is possible in the electromagnetic imaging. In the first part of the paper, the possible resolution of image is investigated in the inversion of farfield data using the diffraction tomographic (DT) algorithm, where two cases are considered when the object is in a homogeneous space and in an air-earth half space. The study shows that the resolution of image for inversion of far-field data has been limited theoretically to 0.3536--0.5 wavelength using the DT algorithm in homogeneous-space problems, and it is even worse in half-space problems. If the transmitters and receivers are located in the near-field regime, however, the image resolution is less than 0.25 wavelength, which is the super-resolution phenomenon. In the second part of the paper, the physical reason for the super-resolution phenomenon is investigated using different electromagnetic inverse scattering methods. The study has demonstrated that the information of evanescent waves in the measurement data and its involvement in inversion algorithms is the main reason for the super resolution. Four inversion algorithms are considered for half-space problems: the DT algorithm, the spatial-domain Born approximation (BA), the Born iterative method (BIM), and the distorted BIM (DBIM). The first two belong to linear inverse scattering, while the last two belong to nonlinear inverse scattering. Further analysis shows that DBIM provides a better super resolution than BIM, and BIM provides a better super resolution than BA. Numerical simulations validate the above conclusions.},

State-of-the-art solutions for vehicle sensing may not build accurate and complete knowledge of all vehicle trajectories. In order to fill the gap, this paper proposes VeTrac, a comprehensive system that employs widely deployed traffic cameras as a sensing network to trace vehicle movements and reconstruct their trajectories in a large scale. VeTrac fuses mobility correlation and vision-based analysis to reduce uncertainties in identifying vehicles. A graph convolution process is employed to maintain the identity consistency across different camera observations, and a self-training process is invoked when aligning with the urban road network to reconstruct vehicle trajectories with confidence. Extensive experiments with real-world data input of over 7 million vehicle snapshots from over one thousand traffic cameras demonstrate that VeTrac achieves 98\% accuracy for simple expressway scenario and 89\% accuracy for complex urban environment. The achieved accuracy outperforms alternative solutions by 32\% for expressway scenario and by 59\% for complex urban environment.},

  abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is a key technology for enabling ubiquitous applications that interconnect with cyber-physical systems in various environments. However, its large scale adoption is strongly impeded by the limited energy available for most IoT devices that are battery-powered, and further challenged by the growing demands to pack increasing functionalities into IoT devices while shrinking their sizes. To address these problems, researchers have developed techniques for energy harvesting, wireless power transfer, and minimizing power consumption in the sensing, communication and computation components of IoT nodes, as found in many surveys. In contrast, this paper surveys Backscatter Communication (BackCom), a recently emerged technique that enables green IoT through joint wireless communication and sensing and potentially allows IoT devices to operate without batteries. The operating principle of BackCom-based green IoT, its architecture and evolution are presented. Also state-of-the-art applications such as healthcare, agriculture, human activity recognition, transportation and mobile IoT are reviewed together with the operational and security challenges faced by these applications and potential solution techniques to address these challenges while ensuring a high energy efficiency. Lastly, some future applications of BackCom-based green IoT are discussed.},

The solution, satisfying any of the usual prescribed boundary conditions simultaneously at the surface of each cylinder, is expressed as the incident wave plus a sum of various orders of scattering. The first order of scattering (the usual single scattering approximation) results from the excitation of each cylinder by only the plane wave or primary excitation. The second order results from the excitation of each cylinder by the first order of scattering from the remaining cylinders, and so on to an infinite order of scattering. The first order therefore consists of waves scattered by one cylinder; the second order of waves scattered by two cylinders, etc. The scattering coefficients of the m'th order of scattering are expressed recursively in terms of the previous orders, and finally as sums of products of m scattering coefficients of the single cylinder and Hankel and trigonometric functions depending on the geometry of the configuration.},

To solve this problem, wireless sensing has attracted the attention of many researchers because it enables device-free and/or maintenance-free context recognition.

@article{UniversalApproximationTheorem2024,
  title = {Universal Approximation Theorem},
  year = {2024},
  month = may,
  journal = {Wikipedia},
  urldate = {2024-05-29},
  abstract = {Artificial neural networks are combinations of multiple simple mathematical functions that implement more complicated functions from (typically) real-valued vectors to real-valued vectors.  The spaces of multivariate functions that can be implemented by a network are determined by the structure of the network, the set of simple functions, and its multiplicative parameters.  A great deal of theoretical work has gone into characterizing these function spaces. In the mathematical theory of artificial neural networks, universal approximation theorems are results that put limits on what neural networks can theoretically learn.  Specifically, given an algorithm that generates the networks within a class of functions, the theorems establish the density of the generated functions within a given function space of interest.  Typically, these results concern the approximation capabilities of the feedforward architecture on the space of continuous functions between two Euclidean spaces, and the approximation is with respect to the compact convergence topology. What must be stressed, is that while some functions can be arbitrarily well approximated in a region, the proofs do not apply outside of the region, i.e. the approximated functions do not extrapolate outside of the region. That applies for all non-periodic activation functions, i.e. what's in practice used and most proofs assume. In recent years neocortical pyramidal neurons with oscillating activation function that can individually learn the XOR function have been discovered in the human brain and oscillating activation functions have been explored and shown to outperform popular activation functions on a variety of benchmarks. However, there are also a variety of results between non-Euclidean spaces and other commonly used architectures and, more generally, algorithmically generated sets of functions, such as the convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, radial basis functions, or neural networks with specific properties. Most universal approximation theorems can be parsed into two classes. The first quantifies the approximation capabilities of neural networks with an arbitrary number of artificial neurons ("arbitrary width" case) and the second focuses on the case with an arbitrary number of hidden layers, each containing a limited number of artificial neurons ("arbitrary depth" case). In addition to these two classes, there are also universal approximation theorems for neural networks with bounded number of hidden layers and a limited number of neurons in each layer ("bounded depth and bounded width" case). Universal approximation theorems imply that neural networks can represent a wide variety of interesting functions with appropriate weights. On the other hand, they typically do not provide a construction for the weights, but merely state that such a construction is possible. To construct the weight, neural networks are trained, and they may converge on the correct weights, or not (i.e. get stuck in a local optimum). If the network is too small (for the dimensions of input data) then the universal approximation theorems do not apply, i.e. the networks will not learn. What was once proven about the depth of a network, i.e. a single hidden layer enough, only applies for one dimension, in general such a network is too shallow. The width of a network is also an important hyperparameter. The choice of an activation function is also important, and some work, and proofs written about, assume e.g. ReLU (or sigmoid) used, while some, such as a linear are known to not work (nor any polynominal). Neural networks with an unbounded (non-polynomial) activation function have the universal approximation property. The universal approximation property of width-bounded networks has been studied as a dual of classical universal approximation results on depth-bounded networks. For input dimension dx and output dimension dy  the minimum width required for the universal approximation of the Lp functions is exactly max\{dx + 1, dy\} (for a ReLU network).  More generally this also holds if both ReLU and a threshold activation function are used.},

In this paper, we demonstrate that this is not necessarily the case for some devices equipped with backscatter radios. We present LOREA an architecture consisting of a tag, a reader and multiple carrier generators that overcomes the power, cost and range limitations of existing systems such as Computational Radio Frequency Identification (CRFID). LOREA achieves this by: First, generating narrow-band backscatter transmissions that improve receiver sensitivity. Second, mitigating self-interference without the complex designs employed on RFID readers by keeping carrier signal and backscattered signal apart in frequency. Finally, decoupling carrier generation from the reader and using devices such as WiFi routers and sensor nodes as a source of the carrier signal. An off-the-shelf implementation of LOREA costs 70 USD, a drastic reduction in price considering commercial RFID readers cost 2000 USD. LOREA's range scales with the carrier strength, and proximity to the carrier source and achieves a maximum range of 3.4 km when the tag is located at 1 m distance from a 28 dBm carrier source while consuming 70 {$\mu$}W at the tag. When the tag is equidistant from the carrier source and the receiver, we can communicate upto 75 m, a significant improvement over existing RFID readers.},

Backscatter tags achieve this by the reflection or absorption of carrier signal generated from emitter devices. However, backscatter systems are limited by these emitter devices, as they are significantly energy-expensive when compared to the tags. While backscatter tags can operate without requiring batteries, relying on the minuscule amounts of energy harvested from the ambient environment. However, the emitter devices, are commonly tethered to an external power supply or operate on large batteries. We present Tunnel Emitter: a tunnel diode oscillator based system that enables the generation of carrier signals at a peak biasing power of tens of {$\mu$}W. Thus, for the first time, it allows battery-free emitter devices. The key enabler to the design is a phenomenon exhibited by tunnel diode oscillators that we call back injection, and we are the first to demonstrate. Back injection enables the emitter devices to amplify (up to 20 dB) and relay the backscattered signal. Our results show that Tunnel Emitter when operating together with a tag from long-range backscatter system, facilitates multi-floor communication. Tunnel Emitter, due to the back injection phenomenon, achieves this with a carrier signal that is orders of magnitude weaker than used in state-of-the-art systems. We believe Tunnel Emitter overcomes the key constraint restricting backscatter systems and thus can make backscatter systems ubiquitous.},

  abstract = {Deep learning methods have become ubiquitous tools in many Earth observation applications, delivering stateof-the-art results while proving to generalize for a variety of scenarios. One such domain concerns the Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite mission, which provides multispectral images in the form of 13 spectral bands, captured at three different spatial resolutions: 10, 20, and 60 m. This research aims to provide a super-resolution mechanism based on fully convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for upsampling the low-resolution (LR) spectral bands of S2 up to 10-m spatial resolution. Our approach is centered on attaining good performance with respect to two main properties: consistency and synthesis. While the synthesis evaluation, also known as Wald's protocol, has spoken for the performance of almost all previously introduced methods, the consistency property has been overlooked as a viable evaluation procedure. Recently introduced techniques make use of sensor's modulation transfer function (MTF) to learn an approximate inverse mapping from LR to high-resolution images, which is on a direct path for achieving a good consistency value. To this end, we propose a multiobjective loss for training our architectures, including an MTF-based mechanism, a direct input--output mapping using synthetically degraded data, along with direct similarity measures between high-frequency details from already available 10-m bands, and super-resolved images. Experiments indicate that our method is able to achieve a good tradeoff between consistency and synthesis properties, along with competitive visual quality results.},

  abstract = {Although past work on RF-based indoor localization has delivered important advances, it typically makes assumptions that hinder its adoption in smart home applications. Most localization systems assume that users carry their phones on them at home, an assumption that has been proven highly inaccurate in past measurements. The few localization systems that do not require the user to carry a device on her, cannot tell the identity of the person; yet identification is essential to most smart home applications. This paper focuses on addressing these issues so that smart homes can benefit from recent advances in indoor localization.             We introduce Duet, a multi-modal system that takes as input measurements from both device-based and device-free localization. Duet introduces a new framework that combines probabilistic inference with first order logic to reason about the users' most likely locations and identities in light of the measurements. We implement Duet and compare it with a baseline that uses state-of-art WiFi-based localization. The results of two weeks of monitoring in two smart environments show that Duet accurately localizes and identifies the users for 94\% and 96\% of the time in the two places. In contrast, the baseline is accurate 17\% and 42\% respectively.},

  abstract = {WiFi based gesture recognition has received significant attention over the past few years. However, the key limitation of prior WiFi based gesture recognition systems is that they cannot recognize the gestures of multiple users performing them simultaneously. In this paper, we address this limitation and propose WiMU, a WiFi based Multi-User gesture recognition system. The key idea behind WiMU is that when it detects that some users have performed some gestures simultaneously, it first automatically determines the number of simultaneously performed gestures (Na ) and then, using the training samples collected from a single user, generates virtual samples for various plausible combinations of Na gestures. The key property of these virtual samples is that the virtual samples for any given combination of gestures are identical to the real samples that would result from real users performing that combination of gestures. WiMU compares the detected sample against these virtual samples and recognizes the simultaneously performed gestures. We implemented and extensively evaluated WiMU using commodity WiFi devices. Our results show that WiMU recognizes 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 simultaneously performed gestures with accuracies of 95.0, 94.6, 93.6, 92.6, and 90.9\%, respectively.},

  abstract = {RFIDs are emerging as a vital component of the Internet of Things. In 2012, billions of RFIDs have been deployed to locate equipment, track drugs, tag retail goods, etc. Current RFID systems, however, can only identify whether a tagged object is within radio range (which could be up to tens of meters), but cannot pinpoint its exact location. Past proposals for addressing this limitation rely on a line-of-sight model and hence perform poorly when faced with multipath effects or non-line-of-sight, which are typical in real-world deployments. This paper introduces the first fine-grained RFID positioning system that is robust to multipath and non-line-of-sight scenarios. Unlike past work, which considers multipath as detrimental, our design exploits multipath to accurately locate RFIDs. The intuition underlying our design is that nearby RFIDs experience a similar multipath environment (e.g., reflectors in the environment) and thus exhibit similar multipath profiles. We capture and extract these multipath profiles by using a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) created via antenna motion. We then adapt dynamic time warping (DTW) techniques to pinpoint a tag's location. We built a prototype of our design using USRP software radios. Results from a deployment of 200 commercial RFIDs in our university library demonstrate that the new design can locate misplaced books with a median accuracy of 11{\textasciitilde}cm.},

This paper introduces TagScan, a system that can identify the material type and image the horizontal cut of a target simultaneously with cheap commercial offthe-shelf (COTS) RFID devices. The key intuition is that different materials and target sizes cause different amounts of phase and RSS (Received Signal Strength) changes when radio frequency (RF) signal penetrates through the target. Multiple challenges need to be addressed before we can turn the idea into a functional system including (i) indoor environments exhibit rich multipath which breaks the linear relationship between the phase change and the propagation distance inside a target; (ii) without knowing either material type or target size, trying to obtain these two information simultaneously is challenging; and (iii) stitching pieces of the propagation distances inside a target for an image estimate is non-trivial. We propose solutions to all the challenges and evaluate the system's performance in three different environments. TagScan is able to achieve higher than 94\% material identification accuracies for 10 liquids and differentiate even very similar objects such as Coke and Pepsi. TagScan can accurately estimate the horizontal cut images of more than one target behind a wall.},

  abstract = {Recently, gesture recognition has gained considerable attention in emerging applications (e.g., AR/VR systems) to provide a better user experience for human-computer interaction. Existing solutions usually recognize the gestures based on wearable sensors or specialized signals (e.g., WiFi, acoustic and visible light), but they are either incurring high energy consumption or susceptible to the ambient environment, which prevents them from efficiently sensing the fine-grained finger movements. In this paper, we present RF-finger, a device-free system based on Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) RFID, which leverages a tag array on a letter-size paper to sense the fine-grained finger movements performed in front of the paper. Particularly, we focus on two kinds of sensing modes: finger tracking recovers the moving trace of finger writings; multi-touch gesture recognition identifies the multi-touch gestures involving multiple fingers. Specifically, we build a theoretical model to extract the fine-grained reflection feature from the raw RF -signal, which describes the finger influence on the tag array in cm- level resolution. For the finger tracking, we leverage K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to pinpoint the finger position relying on the fine-grained reflection features, and obtain a smoothed trace via Kalman filter. Additionally, we construct the reflection image of each multi-touch gesture from the reflection features by regarding the multiple fingers as a whole. Finally, we use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify the multi-touch gestures based on the images. Extensive experiments validate that RF -finger can achieve as high as 88\% and 92\% accuracy for finger tracking and multi-touch gesture recognition, respectively.},

  abstract = {Video scene analysis is a well-investigated area where researchers have devoted efforts to detect and classify people and objects in the scene. However, real-life scenes are more complex: the intrinsic states of the objects (e.g., machine operating states or human vital signals) are often overlooked by vision-based scene analysis. Recent work has proposed a radio frequency (RF) sensing technique, wireless vibrometry, that employs wireless signals to sense subtle vibrations from the objects and infer their internal states. We envision that the combination of video scene analysis with wireless vibrometry form a more comprehensive understanding of the scene, namely "rich scene analysis". However, the RF sensors used in wireless vibrometry only provide time series, and it is challenging to associate these time series data with multiple real-world objects. We propose a real-time RF-vision sensor fusion system, Capricorn, that efficiently builds a cross-modal correspondence between visual pixels and RF time series to better understand the complex natures of a scene. The vision sensors in Capricorn model the surrounding environment in 3D and obtain the distances of different objects. In the RF domain, the distance is proportional to the signal time-of-flight (ToF), and we can leverage the ToF to separate the RF time series corresponding to each object. The RF-vision sensor fusion in Capricorn brings multiple benefits. The vision sensors provide environmental contexts to guide the processing of RF data, which helps us select the most appropriate algorithms and models. Meanwhile, the RF sensor yields additional information that is originally invisible to vision sensors, providing insight into objects' intrinsic states. Our extensive evaluations show that Capricorn real-timely monitors multiple appliances' operating status with an accuracy of 97\%+ and recovers vital signals like respirations from multiple people. A video (https://youtu.be/b-5nav3Fi78) demonstrates the capability of Capricorn.},

  abstract = {Mobile communication networks were designed to mainly support ubiquitous wireless communications, yet they are also expected to achieve radio sensing capabilities in the near future. However, most prior studies on radio sensing usually rely on far-field assumption with uniform plane wave (UPW) models. With the ever-increasing antenna size, together with the growing demands to sense nearby targets, the conventional farfield UPW assumption may become invalid. Therefore, this paper studies near-field radio sensing with extremely large-scale (XL) antenna arrays, where the more general uniform spherical wave (USW) sensing model is considered. Closed-form expressions of the Cram{\'e}r-Rao Bounds (CRBs) for both angle and range estimations are derived for near-field XL-MIMO radar mode and XL-phased array radar mode, respectively. Our results reveal that different from the conventional UPW model where the CRB for angle decreases unboundedly as the number of antennas increases, for XL-MIMO radar-based near-field sensing, the CRB decreases with diminishing return and approaches to a certain limit as the number of antennas increases. Besides, different from the far-field model where the CRB for range is infinity since it has no range estimation capability, that for the near-field case is finite. Furthermore, it is revealed that the commonly used spherical wave model based on secondorder Taylor approximation is insufficient for near-field CRB analysis. Extensive simulation results are provided to validate our derived CRBs.},

  abstract = {Device-free gesture tracking is an enabling HCI mechanism for small wearable devices because fingers are too big to control the GUI elements on such small screens, and it is also an important HCI mechanism for medium-to-large size mobile devices because it allows users to provide input without blocking screen view. In this paper, we propose LLAP, a device-free gesture tracking scheme that can be deployed on existing mobile devices as software, without any hardware modification. We use speakers and microphones that already exist on most mobile devices to perform device-free tracking of a hand/finger. The key idea is to use acoustic phase to get fine-grained movement direction and movement distance measurements. LLAP first extracts the sound signal reflected by the moving hand/finger after removing the background sound signals that are relatively consistent over time. LLAP then measures the phase changes of the sound signals caused by hand/finger movements and then converts the phase changes into the distance of the movement. We implemented and evaluated LLAP using commercial-off-the-shelf mobile phones. For 1-D hand movement and 2-D drawing in the air, LLAP has a tracking accuracy of 3.5 mm and 4.6 mm, respectively. Using gesture traces tracked by LLAP, we can recognize the characters and short words drawn in the air with an accuracy of 92.3\% and 91.2\%, respectively.},

In this paper, we consider a specific wide-area mapping technique with high-altitude high-speed platform, where range ambiguity suppression is a technical challenge. To resolve this problem, we present a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) with multiple antennas placed in the cross-track direction. The increased degrees-of-freedom (DOFs) provide a potential to resolve possible range and/or azimuth ambiguities. After formalizing the system scheme and signal model, an iterative matched filtering algorithm is presented, which can efficiently suppress the cross-correlation interferences in the multichannel data separation. Furthermore, a range-Doppler based image formation algorithm is derived. The MIMO SAR system performance is evaluated by the range-ambiguity-to-signal ratio (RASR) performance. Numerical simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed MIMO SAR in high-altitude high-speed platform SAR for large-area remote sensing.},

  abstract = {With the advancement of wireless sensing technologies, RF-based contact-less liquid detection attracts more and more attention. Compared with other RF devices, the mmWave radar has the advantages of large bandwidth and low cost. While existing radar-based liquid detection systems demonstrate promising performance, they still have a shortcoming that in the detection result depends on container-related factors (e.g., container placement, container caliber, and container material). In this paper, to enable container-independent liquid detection with a COTS mmWave radar, we propose a dual-reflection model by exploring reflections from different interfaces of the liquid container. Specifically, we design a pair of amplitude ratios based on the signals reflected from different interfaces, and theoretically demonstrate how the refractive index of liquids can be estimated by eliminating the container's impact. To validate the proposed approach, we implement a liquid detection system LiqDetector. Experimental results show that LiqDetector achieves cross-container estimation of the liquid's refractive index with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of about 4.4\%. Moreover, the classification accuracies for 6 different liquids and alcohol with different strengths (even a difference of 1\%) exceed 96\% and 95\%, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that achieves container-independent liquid detection based on the COTS mmWave radar by leveraging only one pair of Tx-Rx antennas.},

In response, we propose MultiRider, the first WiFi backscatter system that can tame in-band interference and support multi-tag parallel communication on commercial OFDM protocol. The principle behind MultiRider lies in its ability to demodulate and reconstruct tag data using just one uncorrupted subcarrier in the spectrum domain. To address the inherent challenges of preamble corruption and data collision due to in-band interference, we design three modules: 1) preamble recovery based on a concurrency-driven backscatter packet structure; 2) subcarrier-level demodulation using uncorrupted subcarriers; and 3) iterative interference cancellation for multiple tags. We prototype and evaluate MultiRider under 802.11g OFDM WiFi signals with commercial adapters and software-defined radios. Comprehensive evaluations illustrate that MultiRider can efficiently solve in-band interference. Notably, it can expand the network capacity of WiFi backscatter by 4{\texttimes} and use 8 channels in the 2.4GHz WiFi band for concurrent communication. Further results reveal that MultiRider can gain 10{\texttimes} network capacity in 35MHz bandwidth and reach 2.29 Mbps system throughput.},

Here, the authors propose a non-contact hand gesture recognition method based on intelligent metasurface. Owing to the advantage of dynamically controlling the electromagnetic (EM) focusing in the wavefront engineering, a transmissive programmable metasurface is presented to illuminate the forearm with more focusing spots and obtain comprehensive echo data, which can be processed under the machine learning technology to reach the non-contact gesture recognition with high accuracy. Compared with the traditional passive antennas, unique variations of echo coefficients resulted from near fields perturbed by finger and wrist agonist muscles can be aquired through the programmable metasurface by switching the positions of EM focusing. The authors realize the gesture recognition using support vector machine algorithm based on five individual focusing spots data and all-five-spot data. The influences of the focusing spots on the gesture recognition are analyzed through linear discriminant analysis algorithm and Fisher score. Experimental verifications prove that the proposed metasurface-based non-contact wireless design can realize the classification of hand gesture recognition with higher accuracy than traditional passive antennas, and give an HMI solution.},

To extract the point-wise features from the irregularly and sparsely distributed points, previous methods usually take a feature grouping module to aggregate the point features to an object candidate. However, these methods have not yet leveraged the surface geometry of foreground objects to enhance grouping and 3D box generation. In this paper, we propose the RBGNet framework, a voting-based 3D detector for accurate 3D object detection from point clouds. In order to learn better representations of object shape to enhance cluster features for predicting 3D boxes, we propose a ray-based feature grouping module, which aggregates the point-wise features on object surfaces using a group of determined rays uniformly emitted from cluster centers. Considering the fact that foreground points are more meaningful for box estimation, we design a novel foreground biased sampling strategy in downsample process to sample more points on object surfaces and further boost the detection performance. Our model achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection performance on ScanNet V2 and SUN RGB-D with remarkable performance gains. Code will be available at https://github.com/Haiyang-W/RBGNet.},

However, many applications in gaming and gesture based interface see more benefits in knowing the detailed shape of a motion. Such trajectory tracing requires a resolution several fold higher than what existing RF-based positioning systems can offer.             This paper shows that one can provide a dramatic increase in trajectory tracing accuracy, even with a small number of antennas. The key enabler for our design is a multi-resolution positioning technique that exploits an intrinsic tradeoff between improving the resolution and resolving ambiguity in the location of the RF source. The unique property of this design is its ability to precisely reconstruct the minute details in the trajectory shape, even when the absolute position might have an offset. We built a prototype of our design with commercial off-the-shelf RFID readers and tags and used it to enable a virtual touch screen, which allows a user to interact with a desired computing device by gesturing or writing her commands in the air, where each letter is only a few centimeters wide.},

However, as today's smartphones are capable of near-Gbps wireless data rates, current solutions do not efficiently utilize the available bandwidth in this single-hop environment. We show that existing transport schemes suffer from resource-intensive reliable delivery mechanisms, inadequate congestion control, and inefficient flow control for achieving line-rate transmission in peer-topeer Wi-Fi direct links. In this paper, we present SMUFF, a reliable file transfer service that achieves nearly the practical line rate of the underlying wireless bandwidth. We note a unique feature of direct transport -- the sender can monitor each buffer along the data path and determine an optimal sending rate accordingly. Therefore, SMUFF can maximize throughput by strategically backlogging the appropriate amount of data in the bottleneck buffer. We have deployed SMUFF on four different phone models, and our evaluations with other transport schemes show that SMUFF achieves up to 94.7\% of the practical line rate and 22.6\% throughput improvement with a 37\% reduction in CPU usage and a 15\% reduction in power consumption, compared to state-of-the-art solutions.},

  abstract = {Nowadays, the growing demand for the 3D human-computer interaction (HCI) has brought about a number of novel approaches, which achieve the HCI by tracking the motion of different devices, including the translation and the rotation. In this paper, we propose to use a spinning linearly polarized antenna to track the 3D motion of a specified object attached with the passive RFID tag array. Different from the fixed antenna-based solutions, which suffer from the unavoidable signal interferences at some specific positions/orientations, and only achieve the good performance in some feasible sensing conditions, our spinning antenna-based solution seeks to sufficiently suppress the ambient signal interferences and extracts the most distinctive features, by actively spinning the antenna to create the optimal sensing condition. Moreover, by leveraging the matching/mismatching property of the linearly polarized antenna, i.e., in comparison to the circularly polarized antenna, the phase variation around the matching direction is more stable, and the RSSI variation in the mismatching direction is more distinctive, we are able to find more distinctive features to estimate the position and the orientation. We build a model to investigate the RSSI and the phase variation of the RFID tag along with the spinning of the antenna, and further extend the model from a single RFID tag to an RFID tag array. Furthermore, we design corresponding solutions to extract the distinctive RSSI and phase values from the RF-signal variation. Our solution tracks the translation of the tag array based on the phase features, and the rotation of the tag array based on the RSSI variation. The experimental results show that our system can achieve an average error of 13. 6cm in the translation tracking, and an average error of 8.3{$^\circ$} in the rotation tracking in the 3D space.},

However, they do not optimize the balance between throughput and spectrum occupancy, both of which serve as pivotal parameters in concurrent transmissions. Moreover, these works also introduce complex components on tag thereby increasing both power consumption and deployment costs. In this article, we propose               Spray               , a tag-lightweight system to achieve high throughput and narrow-band occupancy with low power. The key idea is to incorporate an agile channel allocating and scheduling mechanism into the backscatter network. This approach allows for efficient spectrum utilization and concurrency without the need for energy-intensive components. To optimize throughput in the presence of the challenge of harmonic interference, we introduce a novel algorithm that determines the channels with an optimal combination of central frequencies and bandwidths. Additionally, we propose a fair scheduling strategy to ensure equitable transmission opportunities for all tags. We prototype the               Spray               tag using commercial off-the-shelf components and implement the excitation and receiver with software-defined radio platform. Our evaluation shows that the system supports 30 parallel tags transmitting in the bandwidth of 600 kHz and the throughput can reach more than 280 kbps.},

  abstract = {Target detection is studied for a cloud multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar using quantized measurements. According to the local sensor quantization strategies and fusion strategies, this paper discusses three methods: quantize local test statistics which are linearly fused (QTLF), quantize local test statistics which are optimally fused (QTOF), and quantize local received signals which are optimally fused (QROF). We first directly analyze the detection performance of each method when the quantizer output is represented as a discrete random variable, where it is difficult to obtain a closed-form expression for the detection probability. Then, an approximate description for the quantization is analyzed for the case of a Gaussian signal and a closed-form expression for the detection probability is obtained. We prove that the QTOF method outperforms the QTLF method in general, and for small SCNR the QROF method has the best detection performance among the three methods, while for large SCNR the QROF method performs the worst. The correctness of theoretical analysis is verified by simulations.},

  abstract = {This paper explores building an ultra-low latency and high-accuracy location tracking solution using battery-free tags. While there is rich prior work on location tracking with battery-free RFID tags and backscatter devices, these systems typically face tradeoffs with accuracy, power consumption, and latency. Such limitations make these existing solutions unsuitable for emerging applications like industrial augmented reality which requires tracking fast-moving machinery; monitoring indoor sports activities that require real-time tracking of fast-moving objects with high precision and under stringent latency constraints.             We propose and demonstrate FastLoc, a precision tracking system that locates tiny, battery-free analog backscatter tags at sub-millisecond latency and sub-centimeter accuracy. FastLoc is a hybrid system that simultaneously uses RF and optical signals to track tiny tags that can be attached to everyday objects. FastLoc leverages the RF channel responses from tags for estimating the coarse region where the tags may be located. It simultaneously uses the sensed optical information modulated on the backscatter signals to enable fine-grained location estimation within the coarse region. To achieve this, we design and fabricate a custom analog tag that consumes less than 150 uW and instantaneously converts incident optical signals to one-shot wideband harmonic RF responses at nanosecond latency. We then develop a static high-density distributed-frequency structured light pattern that can localize tags in the area of interest at a sub-centimeter accuracy and microsecond-scale latency. A detailed experimental evaluation of FastLoc shows a median accuracy of 0.7 cm in tag localization with a 0.51 ms effective localization latency.},

This paper investigates the possibility of using RF signals to test the internal status of packages and detect abnormal internal changes. Towards this goal, we design and implement a nondestructive package testing and verification system using commodity passive RFID systems, called Echoscope. Echoscope extracts unique features from the backscatter signals penetrating the internal space of a package and compares them with the previously collected features during the check-in phase. The use of backscatter signals guarantees that there is no difference in RF sources and the features reflecting the internal status will not be affected. Compared to other nondestructive testing methods such as X-ray and ultrasound, Echoscope is much cheaper and provides ubiquitous usage. Our experiments in practical environments show that Echoscope can achieve very high accuracy and is very sensitive to various types abnormal changes.},

  abstract = {Radio frequency (RF) devices such as Wi-Fi transceivers, radio frequency identification tags, and millimeter-wave radars have appeared in large numbers in daily lives. The presence and movement of humans can affect the propagation of RF signals, further, this phenomenon is exploited for human action recognition. Compared to camera solutions, RF approaches exhibit greater resilience to occlusions and lighting conditions, while also raising fewer privacy concerns in indoor scenarios. However, current works have many limitations, including the unavailability of datasets, insufficient training samples, and simple or limited action categories for specific applications, which seriously hinder the growth of RF solutions, presenting a significant obstacle in transitioning RF sensing research from the laboratory to a wide range of everyday life applications. To facilitate the transitioning, in this paper, we introduce and release a large-scale multiple radio frequency dataset, named XRF55, for indoor human action analysis. XRF55 encompasses 42.9K RF samples and 55 action classes of human-object interactions, human-human interactions, fitness, body motions, and human-computer interactions, collected from 39 subjects within 100 days. These actions were meticulously selected from 19 RF sensing papers and 16 video action recognition datasets. Each action is chosen to support various applications with high practical value, such as elderly fall detection, fatigue monitoring, domestic violence detection, etc. Moreover, XRF55 contains 23 RFID tags at 922.38MHz, 9 Wi-Fi links at 5.64GHz, one mmWave radar at 60-64GHz, and one Azure Kinect with RGB+D+IR sensors, covering frequency across decimeter wave, centimeter wave, and millimeter wave. In addition, we apply a mutual learning strategy over XRF55 for the task of action recognition. Unlike simple modality fusion, under mutual learning, three RF modalities are trained collaboratively and then work solely. We find these three RF modalities will promote each other. It is worth mentioning that, with synchronized Kinect, XRF55 also supports the exploration of action detection, action segmentation, pose estimation, human parsing, mesh reconstruction, etc., with RF-only or RF-Vision approaches.

  abstract = {Traditional channel capacity based on the discrete spatial dimensions mismatches the continuous electromagnetic fields. For the wireless communication system in a limited region, the spatial discretization may results in information loss because the continuous field can not be perfectly recovered from the sampling points. Therefore, electromagnetic information theory based on spatially continuous electromagnetic fields becomes necessary to reveal the fundamental theoretical capacity bound of communication systems. In this paper, we propose analyzing schemes for the performance limit between continuous transceivers. Specifically, we model the communication process between two continuous regions by random fields. Then, for the white noise model, we use Mercer expansion to derive the mutual information between the source and the destination. For the close-form expression, an analytic method is introduced based on autocorrelation functions with rational spectrum. Moreover, the Fredholm determinant is used for the general autocorrelation functions to provide the numerical calculation scheme. Further works extend the white noise model to colored noise and discuss the mutual information under it. Finally, we build an ideal model with infinite-length source and destination which shows a strong correpsondence with the time-domain model in classical information theory. The mutual information and the capacity are derived through the spatial spectral density.},

  abstract = {3D orientation tracking is an essential ingredient for many Internet-of-Things applications. Yet existing orientation tracking systems commonly require motion sensors that are only available on battery-powered devices. In this paper, we propose Tagyro, which attaches an array of passive RFID tags as orientation sensors on everyday objects. Tagyro uses a closed-form model to transform the run-time phase offsets between tags into orientation angle. To enable orientation tracking in 3D space, we found the key challenge lies in the imperfect radiation pattern of practical tags, caused by the antenna polarity, non-isotropic emission and electromagnetic coupling, which substantially distort phase measurement. We address these challenges by designing a set of phase sampling and recovery algorithms, which together enable reliable orientation sensing with 3 degrees of freedom. We have implemented a real-time version of Tagyro on a commodity RFID system. Our experiments show that Tagyro can track the 3D orientation of passive objects with a small error of 4{$^\circ$}, at a processing rate of 37.7 samples per second.},

In this article, the deep cooperation in ISAC system including three perspectives is investigated. In the microscopic perspective, namely, within a single node, the sensing information carried by time-frequency-space-code domain resources is processed, such as phase compensation, coherent accumulation and other operations, thereby improving the sensing accuracy. In the mesoscopic perspective, the sensing accuracy could be improved through the cooperation of multiple nodes. We explore various multi-node cooperative sensing scenarios and present the corresponding challenges and future research trends. In the macroscopic perspective, the massive number of infrastructures from the same operator or different operators could perform cooperative sensing to extend the sensing coverage and improve the sensing continuity. We investigate network architecture, target tracking methods, and the large-scale sensing assisted digital twin construction. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of multi-nodes and multi-resources cooperative sensing over non-cooperative sensing. This article may provide a deep and comprehensive view on the cooperative sensing in ISAC system to enhance the performance of sensing, supporting the applications of IoE.},

ISPs are highly nonlinear due to multiple scattering, and iterative algorithms with regularizations are often used to solve such problems. However, they are associated with heavy computational cost, and consequently, they are often time-consuming. This paper proposes the convolutional neural network (CNN) technique to solve full-wave ISPs. We introduce and compare three training schemes based on U-Net CNN, including direct inversion, backpropagation, and dominant current schemes (DCS). Several representative tests are carried out, including both synthetic and experimental data, to evaluate the performances of the proposed methods. It is demonstrated that the proposed DCS outperforms the other two schemes in terms of accuracy and is able to solve typical ISPs quickly within 1 s. The proposed deep-learning inversion scheme is promising in providing quantitative images in real time.},

  abstract = {Owing to the plentiful information released by the commodity devices, WiFi signals have been widely studied for various wireless sensing applications. In many works, both received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and the channel state information (CSI) are utilized as the key factors for precise sensing. However, the calculation and relationship between RSSI and CSI is not explained in detail. Furthermore, there are few works focusing on the measurement variation of the WiFi signal which impacts the sensing results. In this paper, the relationship between RSSI and CSI is studied in detail and the measurement variation of amplitude and phase information is investigated by extensive experiments. In the experiments, transmitter and receiver are directly connected by power divider and RF cables and the signal transmission is quantitatively controlled by RF attenuators. By changing the intensity of attenuation, the measurement of RSSI and CSI is carried out under different conditions. From the results, it is found that in order to get a reliable measurement of the signal amplitude and phase by commodity WiFi, the attenuation of the channels should not exceed 60 dB. Meanwhile, the difference between two channels should be lower than 10 dB. An active control mechanism is suggested to ensure the measurement stability. The findings and criteria of this work is promising to facilitate more precise sensing technologies with WiFi signal.},

The unconstrained orbital mechanism and low fuel consumption advantages for using synthetic aperture radar over the satellites and airplanes navigation systems make these conditions superior for a wide range of services, monitoring, earth observation, and sensing applications. The augmented integration within the existing global navigation system can help in measuring the direction-of-arrival, as well as collecting and distributing accurate location information. For wireless sensing applications, it can enable a new range of opportunities, a wide range of smart sensor applications as experimental platforms for deployment of new technologies.

  abstract = {The forthcoming generation of wireless technology, 6G, promises a revolutionary leap beyond traditional data-centric services. It aims to usher in an era of ubiquitous intelligent services, where everything is interconnected and intelligent. This vision requires the seamless integration of three fundamental modules: Sensing for information acquisition, communication for information sharing, and computation for information processing and decision-making. These modules are intricately linked, especially in complex tasks such as edge learning and inference. However, the performance of these modules is interdependent, creating a resource competition for time, energy, and bandwidth. Existing techniques like integrated communication and computation (ICC), integrated sensing and computation (ISC), and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) have made partial strides in addressing this challenge, but they fall short of meeting the extreme performance requirements. To overcome these limitations, it is essential to develop new techniques that comprehensively integrate sensing, communication, and computation. This integrated approach, known as Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation (ISCC), offers a systematic perspective for enhancing task performance. This paper begins with a comprehensive survey of historic and related techniques such as ICC, ISC, and ISAC, highlighting their strengths and limitations. It then explores the state-of-the-art signal designs for ISCC, along with network resource management strategies specifically tailored for ISCC. Furthermore, this paper discusses the exciting research opportunities that lie ahead for implementing ISCC in future advanced networks. By embracing ISCC, we can unlock the full potential of intelligent connectivity, paving the way for groundbreaking applications and services.},

  abstract = {Wi-Fi sensing systems leverage wireless signals from widely deployed Wi-Fi devices to realize sensing for a broad range of applications. However, current Wi-Fi sensing systems heavily rely on the channel state information (CSI) to learn the signal propagation characteristics, while the availability of CSI is highly dependent on specific Wi-Fi chipsets. Through a city-scale measurement, we discover that the availability of CSI is extremely limited in operational Wi-Fi devices. In this work, we propose a new wireless sensing system called BeamSense that exploits the compressed beamforming reports (CBR). Due to the extensive support of transmit beamforming in operational Wi-Fi devices, CBR is commonly accessible and hence enables a ubiquitous sensing capability. BeamSense adopts a novel multi-path estimation algorithm that can efficiently and accurately map bidirectional CBR to a multi-path channel based on intrinsic fingerprints. We implement BeamSense on several prevalent models of Wi-Fi devices and evaluated its performance with microbenchmarks and three representative Wi-Fi sensing applications. The results show that BeamSense is capable of enabling existing CSI-based sensing algorithms to work with CBR with high sensing accuracy and improved generalizability.},

  abstract = {Hybrid analog/digital beamforming is a promising technique to realize millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multipleinput multiple-output (MIMO) systems cost-effectively. However, existing hybrid beamforming designs mainly rely on real-time channel training or beam sweeping to find the desired beams, which incurs prohibitive overhead due to a large number of antennas at both the transmitter and receiver with only limited radio frequency (RF) chains. To resolve this challenging issue, in this paper, we propose a new environment-aware hybrid beamforming technique that requires only light real-time training, by leveraging the useful tool of channel knowledge map (CKM) with the user's location information. CKM is a sitespecific database, which offers location-specific channel-relevant information to facilitate or even obviate the acquisition of real-time channel state information (CSI). Two specific types of CKM are proposed in this paper for hybrid beamforming design in mmWave massive MIMO systems, namely channel angle map (CAM) and beam index map (BIM). It is shown that compared with existing environment-unaware schemes, the proposed environment-aware hybrid beamforming scheme based on CKM can drastically improve the effective communication rate, even under moderate user location errors, thanks to its great saving of the prohibitive real-time training overhead.},

Nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and spectrum sensing (SS) are considered key candidate technologies for next-generation wireless communications to improve spectrum utilization. Nevertheless, using both technologies at the same time makes the system more complex and brings new challenges to user differentiation. In order to make better use of these advantages, we creatively propose a feature detection-based SS method for NOMA systems. To better distinguish the relationship between the presence or absence of signals from different NOMA users, we employ feature detection to obtain the feature values of each user. We propose workflows and transceiver architectures combining the two technologies. Based on the relationship among users' priorities, power, and transmission in common scenarios, we design a downlink mode and two uplink modes and deduce the threshold settings of the corresponding modes. Meanwhile, we also customarily propose enhanced algorithms, to have a marked increase in the performance for the proposed method in various modes. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed technique is feasible and has prominent detection performance and satisfying throughput performance.},

  abstract = {Target material sensing in ubiquitous contexts plays an important role in various applications. Recently, a few wireless sensing systems have been proposed for material identification. Yet, prior work usually requires to capture the signals penetrating a target (with devices set up on both sides of the target) or to instrument the target (e.g., by attaching an RFID tag), relies on multiple transceivers, and/or involves unexplainable feature engineering. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of material identification by analyzing only the signals reflected off the target, rather than those penetrating it, with a single RF radio. We present mSense, a mobile material sensing system using a single millimeter-wave (mmWave) radio. At the core of mSense is the insight that different materials reflect RF signals in distinct ways. We propose a novel and easy-to-measure material reflection feature that quantitatively characterizes the material's reflectivity. A set of techniques are then devised to achieve accurate and robust material identification despite various factors, including device mobility, hardware defects of commodity mmWave radios, environmental interferences, and etc. Experiments using commercial mmWave networking chipsets demonstrate an average accuracy of 93\% in categorizing five common types of materials: aluminum, ceramic, plastic, wood, and water, regardless of their different sizes and thicknesses. The accuracy retains about 90\% even in mobile scenarios (i.e., a user holds and moves the radio to perform sensing), which shows the great potential of mSense for mobile applications. A case study on 21 daily objects of various materials, shapes, and textures over different days further validates the performance in differentiating real-life objects.},

While model-based device-free sensing approaches analyze and recognize human behaviors by constructing mathematical relationships among WiFi devices, environment, human position/posture, and received channel state information, they have attracted great attention because of the interpretable physical meaning and the ability to guide the WiFi-based sensing system design. In this paper, we retrospect two general-purpose sensing models, i.e., the Fresnel zone model and CSI-ratio model, and demonstrate how these two models are leveraged to extract insightful properties and support a variety of device-free sensing applications.},

However, due to the inherent sensing uncertainty in mobile sensor networks and the unavailability of the ground truth, achieving effective and accurate evaluation on sensing quality is extremely challenging. In this paper, we propose a confidence-interval based sensing quality evaluation method, leveraging the Fisher information and the asymptotic normality property of maximum likelihood estimation. The simulation results demonstrate our method can evaluate the sensing quality more reasonably and accurately than the status quo method.

  abstract = {A dual-module machine learning scheme is proposed to reconstruct inhomogeneous scatterers with high contrasts and large electrical dimensions. The first nonlinear mapping module (NMM) is an extreme learning machine (ELM), which is used to convert the measured scattered fields at the receiver arrays into the preliminary images of the scatterers. The second image-enhancing module (IEM) is a convolutional neural network (CNN), which is used to refine further the images from the NMM to obtain high-accuracy pixel-based model parameter distribution in the inversion domain. Compared with the traditional approximate methods such as backpropagation, the NMM-IEM machine learning can produce the preliminary image with a much higher accuracy but the unknown weight matrices of the ELM are only solved once during training. Hence, the IEM connected to the NMM has a simple architecture and can be trained at a rather low cost. The performance of the proposed dual-module NMM-IEM scheme and the conventional variational Born iterative method is compared in terms of inversion of scatterers with different electrical sizes and contrasts. Meanwhile, the NMM-IEM is also assessed for the inversion of scatterers with high contrasts and large electrical dimensions and experimental data. Finally, the NMM-IEM is compared with the CNNs used in the previous works.},

Existing movement tracking systems, including those based on vision, ultrasound or wireless technologies, fail to offer high tracking accuracy, no learning/training/calibration process, low tracking latency, low cost and easy to deploy at the same time. In this work, we design and evaluate a wireless backscattering based handwriting tracking system, called MilliBack, that satisfies all these requirements. At the heart of MilliBack are two Phase Differential Iterative (PDI) schemes that can infer the position of the backscatter tag (which is attached to a writing tool) from the change in the signal phase. By adopting carefully-designed differential techniques in an iterative manner, we can take the diversity of devices out of the equation. The resulting position calculation has a linear complexity with the number of samples, ensuring fast and accurate tracking.             We have put together a MilliBack prototype and conducted comprehensive experiments. We show that our system can track various handwriting traces accurately, in some testings it achieve a median error of 4.9 mm. We can accurately track and reconstruct arbitrary writing/drawing trajectories such as equations, Chinese characters or just random shapes. We also show that MilliBack can support relatively high writing speed and smoothly adapt to the changes of working environment.},

  abstract = {Driven by a wide range of real-world applications, several ground-breaking RF-based motion-recognition systems were proposed to detect and/or recognize macro/micro human movements. These systems often suffer from various interferences caused by multiple-users moving simultaneously, resulting in extremely low recognition accuracy. Even if the repetitive motions are fairly well detectable through the wireless signals in theory, in reality they get blended into various other system noises during the motion. Moreover, irregular motion patterns among users will lead to expensive computation cost for motion recognition. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel wireless sensing system, called Motion-Fi{\textbackslash} {\textasciicircum}++, which marries battery-free wireless backscattering and device-free sensing in one clean sheet. Motion-Fi{\textbackslash} {\textasciicircum}++ is an accurate, interference tolerable motion-recognition system, which counts repetitive motions without using scenario-dependent templates or profiles and enables multi-user performing certain motions simultaneously because of the relatively short transmission range of backscattered signals and dedicated signal separation method. We implement a backscattering wireless platform to validate our design in various scenarios for over 6 months when different persons, distances and orientations are incorporated. In our experiments, the periodicity in motions could be recognized without any learning or training process, and the accuracy of counting such motions can be achieved within 5 percent count error. With little efforts in learning the patterns, our method could achieve 95.2 percent motion-recognition accuracy for a variety of 7 typical motions. Moreover, by leveraging the periodicity of motions, the recognition accuracy could be further improved to nearly 100 percent with only three repetitions. Our experiments also show that the motions of multiple persons separating by around 2 meters cause little accuracy reduction in the counting process.},

In this paper, we propose a comprehensive localization and tracking scheme by attaching two RFID tags to one object. Instead of using per-tag localization pattern, adding one-more RFID tag to the object exhibits several benefits: 1) providing rich freedom in RFID reader's antenna spacing and placement; 2) supporting accurate calibration of the reader's antenna location and spacing, and 3) enabling fine-grained calculation on the orientation of the tags. All of these advantages ultimately improve the localization/tracking accuracy. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that the average errors of localization and orientation of target tags are 6.415 cm and 1.330{$^\circ$}, respectively. Our results also verify that the reader's antenna geometry does have impact on tag positioning performance.},

While hyperspectral camera, infrared, X-Ray, and Radar provide potential solutions for material identification, high cost is the major concern limiting their applications. In this paper, we explore the capability of employing RF signals for fine-grained material sensing with commodity RFID device. The key reason for our system to work is that the tag antenna's impedance is changed when it is close or attached to a target. The amount of impedance change is dependent on the target's material type, thus enabling us to utilize the impedance-related phase change available at commodity RFID devices for material sensing. Several key challenges are addressed before we turn the idea into a functional system: (i) the random tag-reader distance causes an additional unknown phase change on top of the phase change caused by the target material; (ii) the tag rotations cause phase shifts and (iii) for conductive liquid, there exists liquid reflection which interferes with the impedance-caused phase change. We address these challenges with novel solutions. Comprehensive experiments show high identification accuracies even for very similar materials such as Pepsi and Coke.},

In this paper, we propose RF-glove, a system that recognizes concurrent multiple finger micromovement using RF signals, so as to realize the vision of ``multi-touch in the air.'' It uses a commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) RFID reader with three antennas and five COTS tags attached to the five fingers of a glove, one tag per finger. During the process of a user performing finger micromovements, we let the RFID reader continuously interrogate these tags and obtain the backscattered RF signals from each tag. For each antenna-tag pair, the reader obtains a sequence of RF phase values called a phase profile from the tag's responses over time. To tradeoff between accuracy and robustness in terms of matching resolution, we propose a two phase approach, including coarse-grained filtering and fine-grained matching. To tackle the variation of template phase profiles at different positions, we propose a phase-model-based solution to reconstruct the template phase profiles based on the exact locations. Experiment results show that we achieve an average accuracy of 92.1\% under various moving speeds, orientation deviations, and so on.},

The performance of power delay profile obtained using commodity Wi-Fi devices is limited by two dominating factors. The resolution of the derived power delay profile is determined by the channel bandwidth, which is however limited on commodity WiFi. The collected CSI reflects the signal distortions due to both the channel attenuation and the hardware imperfection. A direct derivation of power delay profiles using raw CSI measures, as has been done in the literature, results in significant inaccuracy. In this paper, we present Splicer, a software-based system that derives high-resolution power delay profiles by splicing the CSI measurements from multiple WiFi frequency bands. We propose a set of key techniques to separate the mixed hardware errors from the collected CSI measurements. Splicer adapts its computations within stringent channel coherence time and thus can perform well in the presence of mobility. Our experiments with commodity WiFi NICs show that Splicer substantially improves the accuracy in profiling multipath characteristics, reducing the errors of multipath distance estimation to be less than 2 m. Splicer can immediately benefit upper-layer applications. Our case study with recent single-AP localization achieves a median localization error of 0:95 m.},

However, due to occlusion and signal miss, LiDAR point clouds are in practice 2.5D as they cover only partial underlying shapes, which poses a fundamental challenge to 3D perception. To tackle the challenge, we present a novel LiDAR-based 3D object detection model, dubbed Behind the Curtain Detector (BtcDet), which learns the object shape priors and estimates the complete object shapes that are partially occluded (curtained) in point clouds. BtcDet first identifies the regions that are affected by occlusion and signal miss. In these regions, our model predicts the probability of occupancy that indicates if a region contains object shapes and integrates this probability map with detection features and generates high-quality 3D proposals. Finally, the occupancy estimation is integrated into the proposal refinement module to generate accurate bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on the KITTI Dataset and the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of BtcDet. Particularly for the 3D detection of both cars and cyclists on the KITTI benchmark, BtcDet surpasses all of the published state-of-the-art methods by remarkable margins. Code is released.},

  abstract = {The classic active contour model raises a great promising solution to polygon-based object extraction with the progress of deep learning recently. Inspired by the physical vibration theory, we propose a contour vibration network (CVNet) for automatic building boundary delineation. Different from the previous contour models, the CVNet originally roots in the force and motion principle of contour string. Through the infinitesimal analysis and Newton's second law, we derive the spatial-temporal contour vibration model of object shapes, which is mathematically reduced to second-order differential equation. To concretize the dynamic model, we transform the vibration model into the space of image features, and reparameterize the equation coefficients as the learnable state from feature domain. The contour changes are finally evolved in a progressive mode through the computation of contour vibration equation. Both the polygon contour evolution and the model optimization are modulated to form a close-looping end-toend network. Comprehensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our CVNet over other baselines and state-of-the-art methods for the polygon-based building extraction.

Most existing works require substantial amounts of well-curated labeled data to train IMU-based sensing models, which incurs high annotation and training costs. Compared with labeled data, unlabeled IMU data are abundant and easily accessible. In this work, we present LIMU-BERT, a novel representation learning model that can make use of unlabeled IMU data and extract generalized rather than task-specific features. LIMU-BERT adopts the principle of self-supervised training of the natural language model BERT to effectively capture temporal relations and feature distributions in IMU sensor measurements. However, the original BERT is not adaptive to mobile IMU data. By meticulously observing the characteristics of IMU sensors, we propose a series of techniques and accordingly adapt LIMU-BERT to IMU sensing tasks. The designed models are lightweight and easily deployable on mobile devices. With the representations learned via LIMU-BERT, task-specific models trained with limited labeled samples can achieve superior performances. We extensively evaluate LIMU-BERT with four open datasets. The results show that the LIMU-BERT enhanced models significantly outperform existing approaches in two typical IMU sensing applications.},

On top of that, we design, implement and evaluate PassiveVLC, a novel visible light backscatter communication system. PassiveVLC system enables a battery-free tag device to perform passive communication with the illuminating LEDs over the same light carrier and thus offers several favorable features including battery-free, sniff-proof, and biologically friendly for human-centric use cases. Experimental results from our prototyped system show that PassiveVLC is flexible with tag orientation, robust to ambient lighting conditions, and can achieve up to 1 kbps uplink speed.

Because wireless passive sensor networks reduce the dependence on the batteries, they have great potential to be used in body sensing applications. In a typical sensor network deployment, multiple passive sensor nodes modulate a common carrier. The superimposed reflected signals can be resolved by using Code division multiple access (CDMA) principles. In practical systems however, a strong carrier component will leak to the receiver, causing offset to the constellation points and as a result it will destroy cross correlation properties of the CDMA codes. To address this problem, we propose a code shift modulation instead of vanilla CDMA. We develop maximum likelihood receiver and analyse its performance. Since the complexity of ML detection strategy scales exponentially with the number of sensors, we develop a reduced complexity detection technique based on Probabilistic Data Association (PDA). We demonstrate via numerical simulations that our reduced complexity detector approaches the ML performance.},

As the most natural way to contact with mobile devices, finger touches have shown potentials for user authentication. Most existing approaches utilize finger touches as behavioral biometrics for identifying individuals, which are vulnerable to spoofer attacks. To resist attacks for on-touch user authentication on mobile devices, this paper exploits physical characters of touching fingers by investigating active vibration signal transmission through fingers, and we find that physical characters of touching fingers present unique patterns on active vibration signals for different individuals. Based on the observation, we propose a behavior-irrelevant on-touch user authentication system, TouchPass, which leverages active vibration signals on smartphones to extract only physical characters of touching fingers for user identification. TouchPass first extracts features that mix physical characters of touching fingers and behavior biometrics of touching behaviors from vibration signals generated and received by smartphones. Then, we design a Siamese network-based architecture with a specific training sample selection strategy to reconstruct the extracted signal features to behavior-irrelevant features and further build a behavior-irrelevant on-touch user authentication scheme leveraging knowledge distillation. Our extensive experiments validate that TouchPass can accurately authenticate users and defend various attacks.},

  abstract = {Due to contactless and convenient experiences, WiFi-based device-free fingerprints localization technologies have extensively attracted research attention. However, they are studied based on an assumption that the user is stationary and face a major challenge in the presence of users' motions. That is, because users' motions induced CSI WiFi variations results in inconsistent location fingerprints during training and prediction, leading to system ineffective. To solve this problem, in this article, we propose freeLoc, which aims to free users' motions (even unseen) while maintaining accurate localization. Specifically, we construct a domain adaptation network that defines different users and motions as different domains, and learns domain-independent representations to extract location fingerprints independent of users' motions. Unfortunately, collecting sufficient amounts of WiFi data is difficult. To reduce the cost of labeling data and ensure the performance of domain adaptation network, we utilize adversarial autoencoder to build a data augmentation module to introduce data diversity. We deploy experiments in a real scenario, and the results show that only by labeling three motions of three users, we can achieve accurate localization (the nearest locations are about one meter away) for a total of 36 domains, including 6 users and 6 motions. Compared to other existing technologies, freeLoc can improve location prediction accuracy by up to 35\%.},

In this work, we present an RFID-based solution, Tagbeat, to inspect mechanical vibration using COTS RFID tags and readers. Making sense of micro and high-frequency vibration using random and low-frequency readings of tag has been a daunting task, especially challenging for achieving sub-millisecond period accuracy. Our system achieves these three goals by discerning the change pattern of backscatter signal replied from the tag, which is attached on the vibrating surface and displaced by the vibration within a small range. This work introduces three main innovations. First, it shows how one can utilize COTS RFID to sense mechanical vibration and accurately discover its period with a few periods of short and noisy samples. Second, a new digital microscope is designed to amplify the micro-vibration-induced weak signals. Third, Tagbeat introduces compressive reading to inspect high-frequency vibration with relatively low RFID read rate. We implement Tagbeat using a COTS RFID device and evaluate it with a commercial centrifugal machine. Empirical benchmarks with a prototype show that Tagbeat can inspect the vibration period with a mean accuracy of 0.36ms and a relative error rate of 0.03\%. We also study three cases to demonstrate how to associate our inspection solution with the specific domain requirements.},

The model was evaluated on a large dataset comprising 7,671 individuals, using data from several hospitals in the United States, as well as multiple public datasets. The AI model can detect PD with an area-under-the-curve of 0.90 and 0.85 on held-out and external test sets, respectively. The AI model can also estimate PD severity and progression in accordance with the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (               R               \,=\,0.94,               P               \,=\,3.6\,{\texttimes}\,10               --25               ). The AI model uses an attention layer that allows for interpreting its predictions with respect to sleep and electroencephalogram. Moreover, the model can assess PD in the home setting in a touchless manner, by extracting breathing from radio waves that bounce off a person's body during sleep. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of objective, noninvasive, at-home assessment of PD, and also provides initial evidence that this AI model may be useful for risk assessment before clinical diagnosis.},

This system, called ``modulation in the air'', thus has emerged as a promising technology for green communications and future Internet-of-Things. This paper studies the AmBC system over ambient orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) carriers in the air. We first establish the system model for such AmBC system from spread-spectrum perspective, from which a novel joint design for tag waveform and reader detector is proposed. We construct the test statistic that cancels out the direct-link interference by exploiting the repeating structure of the ambient OFDM signals due to the use of cyclic prefix. The maximum-likelihood detector is proposed to recover the tag bits, for which the optimal threshold is obtained with closed-form expression. Also, we analyze the effect of various system parameters on the transmission rate and detection performance.

In this work, we present a novel anti-counterfeiting system, TagPrint, using COTS RFID tags and readers. Achieving a low-cost and offline genuineness validation utilizing passive tags has been a daunting task. Our system achieves these three goals by leveraging a few of federated tags' fingerprints and geometric relationships. In TagPrint, we exploit a new kind of fingerprint, called phase fingerprint, extracted from the phase value of the backscattered signal, provided by the COTS RFID readers. To further solve the separation challenge, we devise a geometric solution to validate the genuineness. We have implemented a prototype of TagPrint using COTS RFID devices. The system has been tested extensively over 6,000 tags. The results show that our new fingerprint exhibits a good fitness of uniform distribution and the system achieves a surprising Equal Error Rate of 0.1\% for anti-counterfeiting.},

The ultrasonic sonication (US) method and the three-roll mill (TRM) method were performed for the manufacturing of the CNT/epoxy absorbers with different dispersing levels. Microscopic observations revealed that the CNT agglomerates were reduced after the TRM process, and individual CNTs were uniformly dispersed in the epoxy resin. For the same weight content of CNT fillers, the percentage increase of                              between US and TRM samples varies from 35.5\% to 101.7\% while the corresponding increment of                              (dielectric loss) varies from 79.6\% to 248.8\%. A minimum reflection loss for the US sample with 2 wt \% CNTs is only -7.8 dB at 11.3 GHz while the corresponding TRM sample is greatly improved to reach -37.4 dB at 7.76 GHz for the same matching thickness of 3 mm. {\copyright} 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It not only is convenient, but also causes no privacy concern, as compared to other activity recognition techniques such as the vision based technique. Existing WiFi-based methods have achieved high accuracy in static circumstances but have limitations in adapting changes in environment and activities locations. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained adaptive location-independent activity recognition system (FALAR) which leverages WiFi signals to characterize and recognize common activities regardless of inconsistency of mutative surroundings. FALAR applies fine-grained channel state information (CSI) to achieve accurate recognitions. To address the issue of environmental changes, we present a Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) based motion extraction method and a coarse-to-fine search strategy for speedy processing. After a denoising scheme, we introduce Class Estimated Basis Space Singular Value Decomposition (CSVD) to efface the static path in the background, and use nonnegative matrix factorization to distinguish various activities by looking into the signal profiles. We evaluate FALAR using two commodity WiFi routers in a typical office environment. Our results show that it achieves remarkable performance.},

  abstract = {Liquid fraud has plagued people with huge health risks. Liquid fraud detection can help to reduce the risk of liquid hazards. However, existing systems that use biochemical tools or radio frequency signals for liquid sensing are either expensive, intrusive, or inconvenient for public use. In this article, we propose HearLiquid, a low-cost and nonintrusive liquid fraud detection system using commodity acoustic devices. Our insight comes from the fact that acoustic impedance of different liquids results in distinct absorption of the acoustic signal across different frequencies when it travels through the liquid. In specific, we extract the liquid's acoustic absorption and transmission curve (AATC) over multiple frequencies of the acoustic signal for liquid fraud detection. However, accurately measuring the AATC faces multiple challenges. First, due to the hardware diversity and imperfection, different acoustic devices introduce diverse frequency responses, which brings significant deviations to AATCs of the same liquid. Second, different relative positions between acoustic devices and the liquid container result in variations in the AATC, making the detection result inaccurate. To overcome these challenges, we first calibrate the AATC using a dedicated reference AATC to remove the effect of hardware diversity. To bear the variations in AATCs measured from different relative positions, we apply a well-orchestrated data augmentation technique to automatically generate sufficient AATCs for different positions using a small number of collected data. Finally, AATCs are used to train the liquid detection model. We conduct extensive experiments on many important liquid fraud cases and achieve liquid detection accuracy of 92\%--97\%.},

This technology, also called ``modulation in the air,'' has emerged as a promising solution to achieve green communication for future Internet of Things. This paper studies an AmBC system by leveraging the ambient orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulated signals in the air. We first model such AmBC system from a spread-spectrum communication perspective, upon which a novel joint design for BD waveform and receiver detector is proposed. The BD symbol period is designed as an integer multiplication of the OFDM symbol period, and the waveform for BD bit ``0'' maintains the same state within the BD symbol period, while the waveform for BD bit ``1'' has a state transition in the middle of each OFDM symbol period within the BD symbol period. In the receiver detector design, we construct the test statistic that cancels out the direct-link interference by exploiting the repeating structure of the ambient OFDM signals due to the use of cyclic prefix. For the system with a single-antenna receiver, the maximum-likelihood detector is proposed to recover the BD bits, for which the optimal threshold is obtained in closed-form expression. For the system with a multi-antenna receiver, we propose a new test statistic which is a linear combination of the per-antenna test statistics and derive the corresponding optimal detector. The proposed optimal detectors require only knowing the strength of the backscatter channel, thus simplifying their implementation. Moreover, practical timing synchronization algorithms are proposed for the designed AmBC system, and we also analyze the effect of various system parameters on the transmission rate and detection performance. Finally, extensive numerical results are provided to verify that the proposed transceiver design can improve the system bit-error-rate performance and the operating range significantly and achieve much higher data rate, as compared with the conventional design.},

Through it, malware can wirelessly leak information without making network connections or emitting signals, such as sound, EMR, vibration, etc., that we can feel or are aware of. The covert channel is built on a communication method that we call NICScatter. NICScatter transmitter malware forces mobile devices, such as mobile phones, tablets or laptops, to reflect surrounding RF signals to covertly convey information. The operation is achieved by controlling the impedance of a device's wireless network interface card (NIC). Importantly, the operation requires no special privileges on current mobile OSs, which allows the malware to stealthily pass sensitive data to an attacker's nearby mobile device, which can then decode the signal and thus effectively gather the guarded data. Our experiments with different mobile devices show that the covert channel can achieve 1.6 bps and transmit as far as 2 meters. In a through-the-wall scenario, it can transmit up to 70 cm.},

While such systems initially used reflected light as the communication media, direct light becomes the dominant media for the purpose of combating interference. Nonetheless, the data rate achievable by direct light LED-Camera VLC systems has hit its bottleneck: the dimension of the transmitters. In order to further improve the performance, we revisit the reflected light approach and we innovate in converting the potentially destructive interferences into collaborative transmissions. Essentially, our ReflexCode system codes information by superposing light emissions from multiple transmitters. It combines traditional amplitude demodulation with slope detection to "decode" the grayscale modulated signal, and it tunes decoding thresholds dynamically depending on the spatial symbol distribution. In addition, ReflexCode re-engineers the balanced codes to avoid flicker from individual transmitters. We implement ReflexCode as two prototypes and demonstrate that it can achieve a throughput up to 3.2kb/s at a distance of 3m.},

  abstract = {Several recent trends in machine learning theory and practice, from the design of state-of-the-art Gaussian Process to the convergence analysis of deep neural nets (DNNs) under stochastic gradient descent (SGD), have found it fruitful to study wide random neural networks. Central to these approaches are certain scaling limits of such networks. We unify these results by introducing a notion of a straightline {\textbackslash}emph\{tensor program\} that can express most neural network computations, and we characterize its scaling limit when its tensors are large and randomized. From our framework follows (1) the convergence of random neural networks to Gaussian processes for architectures such as recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, residual networks, attention, and any combination thereof, with or without batch normalization; (2) conditions under which the {\textbackslash}emph\{gradient independence assumption\} -- that weights in backpropagation can be assumed to be independent from weights in the forward pass -- leads to correct computation of gradient dynamics, and corrections when it does not; (3) the convergence of the Neural Tangent Kernel, a recently proposed kernel used to predict training dynamics of neural networks under gradient descent, at initialization for all architectures in (1) without batch normalization. Mathematically, our framework is general enough to rederive classical random matrix results such as the semicircle and the Marchenko-Pastur laws, as well as recent results in neural network Jacobian singular values. We hope our work opens a way toward design of even stronger Gaussian Processes, initialization schemes to avoid gradient explosion/vanishing, and deeper understanding of SGD dynamics in modern architectures.},

  abstract = {Through-wall tracking has gained a lot of attentions in civilian applications recently. Many applications would benefit from such device-free tracking, e.g. elderly people surveillance, intruder detection, gaming, etc. In this work, we present a system, named Tadar, for tracking moving objects without instrumenting them us- ing COTS RFID readers and tags. It works even through walls and behind closed doors. It aims to enable a see-through-wall technology that is low-cost, compact, and accessible to civilian purpose. In traditional RFID systems, tags modulate their IDs on the backscatter signals, which is vulnerable to the interferences from the ambient reflections. Unlike past work, which considers such vulnerability as detrimental, our design exploits it to detect surrounding objects even through walls. Specifically, we attach a group of RFID tags on the outer wall and logically convert them into an antenna array, receiving the signals reflected off moving objects. This paper introduces two main innovations. First, it shows how to eliminate the flash (e.g. the stronger reflections off walls) and extract the reflections from the backscatter signals. Second, it shows how to track the moving object based on HMM (Hidden Markov Model) and its reflections. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to implement a through-wall tracking using the COTS RFID systems. Empirical measurements with a prototype show that Tadar can detect objects behind 5" hollow wall and 8" concrete wall, and achieve median tracking errors of 7.8cm and 20cm in the X and Y dimensions.},

  abstract = {Instant delivery is an important urban service in recent years because of the increasing demand. An important issue for delivery platforms is to keep updating the status of couriers especially the real-time locations, which is challenging when they are in an indoor environment. We argue the previous indoor localization techniques cannot be applied in the instant delivery scenario because they require extra deployed infrastructures and extensive labor work. In this work, we perform the couriers' indoor localization transparently in a predictive manner without extra actions of couriers by existing data from the platform including order progress reports and couriers' trajectories. Specifically, we present TransLoc to predict couriers' indoor locations by addressing two challenges including uncertain reporting behaviors and uncertain indoor mobility behaviors. Our key idea lies in two insights (i) couriers' behaviors are consistent in indoor/outdoor environments; (ii) localization, as a spatial inference problem, could be converted to a temporal inference problem. We evaluate TransLoc on 565 couriers from an instant delivery company, which improves baselines by at most 72\%, and achieves a competitive result compared to a label-extensive approach. As a case study, we apply TransLoc to optimize the order dispatching strategy, which reduces the delivery time by 24\%.},

Edges can be located very effectively in the wavelet transform domain. A spatially selective noise filtration technique based on the direct spatial correlation of the wavelet transform at several adjacent scales is introduced. A high correlation is used to infer that there is a significant feature at the position that should be passed through the filter. The authors have tested the technique on simulated signals, phantom images, and real MR images. It is found that the technique can reduce noise contents in signals and images by more than 80\% while maintaining at least 80\% of the value of the gradient at most edges. The authors did not observe any Gibbs' ringing or significant resolution loss on the filtered images. Artifacts that arose from the filtration are very small and local. The noise filtration technique is quite robust. There are many possible extensions of the technique. The authors see its applications in spatially dependent noise filtration, edge detection and enhancement, image restoration, and motion artifact removal. They have compared the performance of the technique to that of the Weiner filter and found it to be superior.{$<>$}},

In this paper, we are interested in using COTS WiFi devices to identify material details, including location, material type, and shape, of stationary objects in the surrounding environment, which may open up new opportunities for many applications. Specifically, we present Wi-Painter, a model-driven system that can accurately detects smooth-surfaced material types and their edges using COTS WiFi devices without modification. Different from previous arts for material identification, Wi-Painter subdivides the target into individual 2D pixels, and simultaneously forms a 2D image based on identifying the material type of each pixel. The key idea of Wi-Painter is to exploit the complex permittivity of the object surface which can be estimated by the different reflectivity of signals with different polarization directions. In particular, we construct the multi-incident angle model to characterize the material, using only the power ratios of the vertically and horizontally polarized signals measured at several different incident angles, which avoids the use of inaccurate WiFi signal phases. We implement and evaluate Wi-Painter in the real world, showing an average classification accuracy of 93.4\% for different material types including metal, wood, rubber and plastic of different sizes and thicknesses, and across different environments. In addition, Wi-Painter can accurately detect the material type and edge of the word "LOVE" spliced with different materials, with an average size of 60cm {\texttimes} 80cm, and material edges with different orientations.},

  abstract = {Coexistence of Wi-Fi and ZigBee in 2.4 GHz ISM band is a long standing and challenging problem. Previous solutions either require modifications of current ZigBee protocols or Wi-Fi re-configurations, which is not feasible in large-scale wireless sensor networks. In this paper, we present WizBee, a coexistence system using single-antenna sink without changing current Wi-Fi and ZigBee design. WizBee is based on an observation that Wi-Fi signal is about 5 to 20 dB stronger than ZigBee signal in symmetric area, which leaves much room for applying interference cancelation technique to mitigate Wi-Fi interference, and extract ZigBee signals. However, we need to cancel the Wi-Fi interference perfectly for residual ZigBee signal decoding, which needs more accurate channel coefficient across data transmissions in spite of cross technology interference. For robust and accurate Wi-Fi decoding, we use soft Viterbi decoding with weighted confidence value over interfered subcarriers. Consequently, our solution uses decoded data for channel coefficient estimation instead of conventional training symbol based methods. The key insight is that, the signal recovery opportunity for cross technology coexistence, lies in multi-domain information, such as power, frequency and coding discrepancies. Using these information properly will improve the coexistence network throughput effectively. We implemented WizBee in USRP/GNURadio software radio platform, and studied the decoding performance of interference cancelation technique. Our extensive evaluations under real wireless conditions show that WizBee improves ZigBee throughput up to 1.9x, with median throughput gain of 1.2x.},

The conventional approaches of resolving EMIS problems encounter assorted difficulties, such as high contrast, high computational cost, inevitable intrinsic nonlinearity, and strong ill-posedness. To surmount these difficulties, a novel DL approach is proposed based on a novel complex-valued deep fully convolutional neural network structure. The proposed complex-valued deep learning model for solving EMIS problems composes of an encoder network and its corresponding decoder network, followed by a final pixel-wise regression layer. The complex-valued encoder network extracts feature fragments from received scattered field data, while the role of the complex-valued decoder network is mapping the feature fragments to retrieve the final contrasts (permittivities) of dielectric scatterers. Hence, the proposed deep learning model functions as an ``heterogeneous'' transformation process, where measured scattering field data is converted into the corresponding contrasts of scatterers. As a consequence, the EMIS problem could be resolved accurately even for extremely high-contrast targets. Numerical benchmarks have illustrated the feasibility and accuracy of our proposed approach. The proposed approach opens a novel path for the deep learning-based real-time quantitative microwave imaging for high-contrast scatterers.},

  abstract = {Despite intensive research efforts in radio frequency noncontact sensing, capturing fine-grained geometric properties of objects, such as shape and size, remains an open problem using commodity WiFi devices. Prior attempts are incapable of characterizing object shape or size because they predominantly rely on weak signals reflected off objects in a very small number of directions. In this paper, motivated by the observation that the diffracted signals around an object between two WiFi devices carry the contour information of the object, we formulate the problem of reconstructing the 2D target profile and develop WiProfile, the first WiFi-based system that unlocks the diffraction effects for target profiling. We introduce a CSI-Profile model to characterize the relationship between the CSI measured at different target positions and the target profile in the diffraction zone. With suitable approximations, the inverse problem of deriving the target profile from CSI can be solved by the inverse Fresnel transform. To mitigate CSI measurement errors on commodity WiFi devices, we propose a novel antenna placement strategy. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that WiProfile can accurately reconstruct profiles with median absolute errors of less than 1 cm under various conditions, and effectively estimate the profiles of everyday objects of diverse shapes, sizes, and materials. We believe this work opens up new directions for fine-grained target imaging using commodity WiFi devices.},

Given diverse radio bands made available in 5G networks, CA plays a particularly critical role in achieving the goal of multi-Gbps throughput performance. In this paper, we carry out a timely comprehensive measurement study of CA deployment in commercial 5G networks (as well as 4G networks). We identify the key factors that influence whether CA is deployed and when, as well as which band combinations are used. Thus, we reveal the challenges posed by CA in 5G performance analysis and prediction as well as their implications in application quality-of-experience (QoE). We argue for and develop a novel CA-aware deep learning framework, dubbed Prism5G, which explicitly accounts for the complexity introduced by CA to more effectively predict 5G network throughput performance. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate the superiority of Prism5G over existing throughput prediction algorithms. Prism5G improves 5G throughput prediction accuracy by over 14\% on average and a maximum of 22\%. Using two use cases as examples, we further illustrate how Prism5G can aid applications in optimizing QoE performance.},

  abstract = {WiFi-based contactless sensing has attracted a tremendous amount of attention due to its pervasiveness, low-cost, and non-intrusiveness to users. Existing systems mainly leverage channel state information (CSI) for sensing. However, CSI can only be extracted from very few commodity WiFi devices through driver hacking, severely limiting the adoption of WiFi sensing in real life. We observe a new opportunity that a large range of new-generation WiFi cards can report another piece of information, i.e., beamforming feedback matrix (BFM). In this paper, we propose to leverage this new BFM information for WiFi sensing. Through establishing the relationship between BFM and CSI, we lay the theoretical foundations for BFM-based WiFi sensing for the first time. We show that through careful signal processing, BFM can be utilized for fine-grained sensing. We showcase the sensing capability of BFM using two representative sensing applications, i.e., respiration sensing and human trajectory tracking. Comprehensive experiments show that BFM-based WiFi sensing can achieve highly accurate sensing performance on a large range of newgeneration WiFi devices from various manufacturers, moving WiFi sensing one big step towards real-life adoption.},

Geolocation databases are designed to store information related to incumbents, and CRs are envisioned to consult this database before spectrum access. Spectrum occupancy and related environment information can be constructed using these geolocation databases. In that regard, Radio Environment Map (REM) is a promising tool that provides a practical means for the realization of cognitive radio networks (CRNs). It constructs a comprehensive map of the CRN by utilizing multi-domain information from geolocation databases, characteristics of spectrum use, geographical terrain models, propagation environment, and regulations. REMs contribute to cognition engines by building long-term knowledge via processing spectrum measurements collected from sensors to estimate the state of locations where there is no measurement data. In addition, REM utilizes feedback from the CRs and can apply various learning tools. The vision is to design CRNs such that CRs, though being simple devices without advanced cognitive functionalities, can become cognitive via REMs and operate in an efficient manner. In this paper, an overview of the REM concept is presented in various dimensions ranging from its architecture and stored information to REM construction techniques as well as REM quality metrics.},

In the absence of prior studies on wireless packet losses for console gaming, through extensive evaluations and user studies, we find that state-of-the-art rate adaptation schemes, unable to keep up with these rapid changes, experience packet loss rates of 2-10\% while loss rates that are 10{\texttimes} lower (0.1-0.5\%) are required to ensure a high quality gaming experience. We present ADR-X, an ANN-based contextual multi-armed bandit rate adaptation technique that continuously predicts and tracks the channel and picks appropriate data rates. A key challenge for ADR-X is that it must run on power and compute constrained embedded devices under realtime constraints. ADR-X addresses this challenge by meticulously crafting an ANN that leverages existing communication theory results to incorporate domain knowledge. This allows ADR-X to achieve 10{\texttimes} lower packet losses than existing schemes while also running 100{\texttimes} faster than stateof-the-art reinforcement learning schemes, making it suitable for deployment on embedded gaming devices.},

  abstract = {电磁逆散射方法建立在全波电磁计算的基础上,故相比于其它微波成像方法,逆散射重建有着更精确且普适的物理模型,和更广泛的应用前景。当前逆散射重建方法大多应用于石油勘探、建筑物内部透视和乳腺癌诊断成像等需要低频电磁波穿透障碍物的场景,故需要对亚波长量级的精细目标进行重建,构成了巨大的挑战。此外,成像区域内金属和非金属材料混杂的情况下,后者的重建极易受前者扰动,给定量重建带来不确定性。最后,在这些复杂场景下,重建方法还要能在非均匀背景下稳定运行,更考验重建方法的鲁棒性。因此,本文主要围绕逆散射重建应用中的三个挑战开展研究:第一,针对混合边界条件问题,本文提出了一种交替参数更新法,实现导体和介质目标的同时精确重建;第二,针对超分辨问题,本文分别从物理超分辨和数学超分辨角度出发,提出了基于超振荡效应和基于材料稀疏先验的逆散射超分辨重建方法;第三,针对非均匀背景扰动情况,本文给出了分区优化的重建的策略。接下来具体介绍针对这三个问题的四个研究内容:1.混合边界条件的逆散射重建方法当散射目标由导体和介质目标混合构成时,导体的趋肤效应导致内部零场,造成阻抗矩阵的秩的缺失。由于导体的存在加剧了逆问题的病态性,介质的逆散射重建严重受到影响。针对该问题,本文首次提出了混合参数模型,将定性划分边界条件的传输系数和定量重建的对比度函数统一在同一个模型中。为了在介质重建时消除导体的病态性影响,本文提出了交替参数更新的方法,分别定量重建介质对比度函数和定性重建导体传输系数,交替迭代更新。从而在单次更新中实现了对阻抗矩阵的降维,缓解了混合问题的病态性,实现了导体和介质混合目标的准确重建。在仿真和实测数据上验证了所提方法,得到了优于分别重建各自参数的重建结果。2.基于物理模型的超分辨重建方法通常基于远场模型的超分辨微波成像方法难以超越衍射极限,即半个波长,而基于精确物理模型的非线性逆散射方法被多次验证能获得亚波长量级的重建精度。虽然大多数学者定性地将其归结于模型中包含了倏逝波转换为传输波的过程,然而缺乏定量推断,因此对这种超分辨能力的理论解释存在众多争议。本文首次从超振荡理论出发,给出了非线性逆散射超分辨重建的解释,并根据超振荡效应和信噪比的关系推出了非线性逆散射重建的极限分辨率。由于超振荡总场能通过非线性作用将目标高频信息混频至格林函数通带,实现信息的压缩。故本文基于该理论提出了两种入射场优化方法,能在给定信噪比下获得小于半波长的重建分辨率。进一步,本文证明了这种基于超振荡效应的超分辨重建方法等价于引入预条件算子的正则化过程,由此说明合适的正则化方法能提高非线性逆散射重建分辨率。所提方法在仿真和实测数据上进行了验证,均取得了优于无超振荡设计的重建效果。3.基于数学先验的超分辨重建方法病态性是逆散射重建中的核心问题,而本文对物理超分辨理论的研究阐明了非线性效应下的正则化过程能获得超分辨的结果。然而,现有的稀疏正则化方法大多基于线性逆问题提出,其要么不适用于复杂的重建目标,要么无法适用于非线性问题的求解。由于大多数重建目标由有限种类材料构成,故本文提出了两种基于材料稀疏性的非线性正则化方法。一种方法是通过选值函数约束非线性解的取值稀疏性,并等效转换为对中间变量的线性正则化项,实现非线性重构中的材料稀疏性约束。另一种方法则是设计多层Bayes模型促进解的取值稀疏性,并通过非线性推断的方式实现重构。所提方法在仿真和实测数据上均得到验证,在相同条件下,所提方法能得到比现有非线性逆散射方法更好的重建结果。4.非均匀背景扰动下的超分辨方法应用非线性逆散射重建的模型建立在体等效原理的基础上,其将重建区域的散射体等效为自由空间的体电流。而在穿墙或是医疗成像等穿透性成像问题中,非均匀背景需要被同时重建,由此扩大了重建区域,并弱化了超振荡效应。本文提出一种分区重建策略,在重建子区的同时将其它分区的影响转入背景格林函数中,由此简化计算量的同时可以进一步在子区内优化超振荡效应,提高重建分辨率,仿真结果验证了所提方法的有效性。综上可见,三类工程问题最终由逆散射问题的数学性质决定,即病态逆问题。因此,本文的所有方法的落脚点均为正则化理论,为逆散射重建问题的进一步深入研究提供了参考。},

It operates by electrically exciting water molecules to emit dipole radiation. The new design of antenna uses a parallel wire transmission line immersed in pure water contained within a PVC barrel, in order to efficiently generate the dipole oscillations. This mode of dipole radiation generation has an optimum signal output when the dipole dielectric conductivity is compared with the water conductivity. When using distilled water having a conductivity of 2 {\texttimes} 10-4S/m, this occurs for frequencies above 30MHz, which is suitable for subsea video signal propagation at 25 frames per second. The barrel antenna produces up to a 40dB increase in emitted signal when compared with a coated double-loop antenna placed directly in the seawater. However, a conventional coated, double-loop antenna in seawater is suitable to be the receiving antenna. The reason is because the double-loop antenna, when operating as a transmitter, has to initially generate on electric field within the seawater, which then excites the water molecules. The receiver can directly pick up the propagated EM wave.},

In this paper, we consider the employment of the integrated (radar) sensing and communication (ISAC) technique for assisting OTFS transmission in both uplink and downlink vehicular communication systems. Benefiting from the OTFS-ISAC signals, the roadside unit (RSU) is capable of simultaneously transmitting downlink information to the vehicles and estimating the sensing parameters of vehicles, e.g., locations and speeds, based on the reflected echoes. Then, relying on the estimated kinematic parameters of vehicles, the RSU can construct the topology of the vehicular network that enables the prediction of the vehicle states in the following time instant. Consequently, the RSU can effectively formulate the transmit downlink beamformers according to the predicted parameters to counteract the channel adversity such that the vehicles can directly detect the information without the need of performing channel estimation. As for the uplink transmission, the RSU can infer the delays and Dopplers associated with different channel paths based on the aforementioned dynamic topology of the vehicular network. Thus, inserting guard space as in conventional methods are not needed for uplink channel estimation which removes the required training overhead. Finally, an efficient uplink detector is proposed by taking into account the channel estimation uncertainty. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the benefits of the proposed ISAC-assisted OTFS transmission scheme.},

We consider a typical packet-based signal structure which includes training and data symbols. We first derive the conditional MI for both sensing and communication under correlated channels by considering the training overhead and channel estimation error (CEE). Then, we derive a lower bound for the CEE and optimize the energy arrangement between the training and data signals to minimize the CEE. Based on the optimal energy arrangement, we provide optimal spatio-temporal power mask design for three scenarios, including maximizing MI for communication only and for sensing only, and maximizing a weighted sum MI for both communication and sensing. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed designs.},

  abstract = {Recent studies show that WiFi interference has been a major problem for low power urban sensing technology ZigBee networks. Existing approaches for dealing with such interferences often modify either the ZigBee nodes or WiFi nodes. However, massive deployment of ZigBee nodes and uncooperative WiFi users call for innovative cross-technology coexistence without intervening legacy systems. In this work we investigate the WiFi and ZigBee coexistence when ZigBee is the interested signal.Mitigating short duration WiFi interference (called flash) in long duration ZigBee data (called smog) is challenging, especially when we cannot modify the WiFi APs and the massively deployed sensor nodes. To address these challenges, we propose ZIMO, a sink-based MIMO design for harmony coexistence of ZigBee and WiFi networks with the goal of protecting the ZigBee data packets.The key insight of ZIMO is to properly exploit opportunities resulted from differences between WiFi and ZigBee, and bridge the gap between interested data and cross technology signals. Also, extracting the channel coefficient of WiFi and ZigBee will enhance other coexistence technologies such as TIMO [1]. We implement a prototype for ZIMO in GNURadio-USRP N200, and our extensive evaluations under real wireless conditions show that ZIMO can improve up to 1.9x throughput for ZigBee network, with median gain of 1.5x, and 1.1x to 1.9x for WiFi network as byproduct in ZigBee signal recovery.},

Unlike existing studies that mostly train a single large network for a specialized task, we prepare a toolbox consisting of small-scale convolutional networks of different complexities and specialized in different tasks. Our method, RL-Restore, then learns a policy to select appropriate tools from the toolbox to progressively restore the quality of a corrupted image. We formulate a stepwise reward function proportional to how well the image is restored at each step to learn the action policy. We also devise a joint learning scheme to train the agent and tools for better performance in handling uncertainty. In comparison to conventional human-designed networks, RL-Restore is capable of restoring images corrupted with complex and unknown distortions in a more parameter-efficient manner using the dynamically formed toolchain1.},

  abstract = {Monitoring sleep posture is important for avoiding bedsores after surgery, reducing apnea events, tracking the progression of Parkinson's disease, and even alerting epilepsy patients to potentially fatal sleep postures. Today, there is no easy way to track sleep postures. Past work has proposed installing cameras in the bedroom, mounting accelerometers on the subject's chest, or embedding pressure sensors in their bedsheets. Unfortunately, such solutions jeopardize either the privacy of the user or their sleep comfort.             In this paper, we introduce BodyCompass, the first RF-based system that provides accurate sleep posture monitoring overnight in the user's own home. BodyCompass works by studying the RF reflections in the environment. It disentangles RF signals that bounced off the subject's body from other multipath signals. It then analyzes those signals via a custom machine learning algorithm to infer the subject's sleep posture. BodyCompass is easily transferable and can apply to new homes and users with minimal effort. We empirically evaluate BodyCompass using over 200 nights of sleep data from 26 subjects in their own homes. Our results show that, given one week, one night, or 16 minutes of labeled data from the subject, BodyCompass's corresponding accuracy is 94\%, 87\%, and 84\%, respectively.},

The resulting breathing signal can be used to infer the person's sleep quality and stages; it also allows for monitoring sleep apnea and other sleep disordered breathing (SDB); all without any body contact. Unfortunately however past work fails when people are close to each other, e.g., a couple sharing the same bed. In this case, the breathing signals of nearby individuals interfere with each other and super-impose in the received signal.             This paper presents DeepBreath, the first RF-based respiration monitoring system that can recover the breathing signals of multiple individuals even when they are separated by zero distance. To design DeepBreath, we model interference due to multiple reflected RF signals and demonstrate that the original breathing can be recovered via independent component analysis (ICA). We design a full system that eliminates interference and recovers the original breathing signals. We empirically evaluate DeepBreath using 21 nights of sleep and over 150 hours of data from 13 couples who share the bed. Our results show that DeepBreath is very accurate. Specifically, the differences between the breathing signals it recovers and the ground truth are on par with the difference between the same breathing signal measured at the person's chest and belly.},

The traditional approach to implementing this type of behavior is through a control plane that is orders of magnitude slower than the speed at which typical data center congestion events occur. More recent alternatives like programmable switches can remember statistics about passing traffic and adjust behavior accordingly, but unfortunately, their capabilities severely limit what can be done. In this paper, we present Mantis, a framework for implementing fine-grained reactive behavior on today's programmable switches with the help of a specialized reactive control plane architecture. Mantis is, thus, a combination of language for specifying dynamic components of packet processing and an optimized, general, and safe control loop for implementing them. Mantis provides a simple-to-reason-about set of abstractions for users, and the Mantis control plane can react to changes in the network in 10s of {$\mu$}s.},

These losses reduce network coverage and, therefore, system availability. The proposed solution is to integrate an Internet of Things (IoT) rainfall monitoring system where it will be able to collect real-time data on the height of rain that erupts in a particular place. This data will help areas where base stations install and the distance of the link that may need to be changed to reduce rainfall's harmful effects. So, the prediction of attenuation due to rain is an essential parameter in both terrestrial and satellite connections. The present study uses the ITU-R P 838 and ITU-R P 530 models to theoretically calculate losses in a 5G wireless broadband link with 99.9\% link availability. This study conducts three frequency bands, 24 GHz, 28 GHz, and 38GHz, in Palo Alto, California. The travel distance is 5km, while the rainfall rate for the analyzed area is in zone D. The results show that the attenuations are proportional to the frequency, polarization, and rainfall rate.},

In a backscatter communication network, uplink transmissions of multiple nodes are usually multiplexed in time- or frequency-domain to avoid collisions, yet it is desirable to improve the uplink capacity further. In this paper, we study a wireless-powered backscatter communication system, where the sensors use a hybrid channel access scheme by combining time division multiplexing access (TDMA) with power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) to enhance the system performance in terms of outage probability and throughput. Our analysis shows that the proposed PD-NOMA increases both the spectrum efficiency and the throughput of the system.},

CKM is a site-specific database, tagged with the locations of the transmitters and/or receivers, that contains whatever channel-related information useful to enhance environmental-awareness and facilitate or even obviate sophisticated real-time channel state information (CSI) acquisition. Therefore, CKM is expected to play an important role for 6G networks targeting for super high capacity, extremely low latency, and ultra-massive connectivity, by offering potential solutions to practical challenges brought by the drastically increased channel dimensions and training overhead. In this article, the motivations of environmental-awareness enabled by CKM are firstly discussed, followed by the key techniques to build and utilize CKM. In particular, it is highlighted that CKM is especially appealing for four channel types: channels for yet-to-reach locations, channels for non-cooperative nodes, channels with large dimensions, and channels with severe hardware/processing limitations. Two case studies with extensive numerical results are presented to demonstrate the great potential of environment-aware communications enabled by CKM.},

  abstract = {We present CrossSense, a novel system for scaling up WiFi sensing to new environments and larger problems. To reduce the cost of sensing model training data collection, CrossSense employs machine learning to train, off-line, a roaming model that generates from one set of measurements synthetic training samples for each target environment. To scale up to a larger problem size, CrossSense adopts a mixture-of-experts approach where multiple specialized sensing models, or experts, are used to capture the mapping from diverse WiFi inputs to the desired outputs. The experts are trained offline and at runtime the appropriate expert for a given input is automatically chosen. We evaluate CrossSense by applying it to two representative WiFi sensing applications, gait identification and gesture recognition, in controlled single-link environments. We show that CrossSense boosts the accuracy of state-of-the-art WiFi sensing techniques from 20\% to over 80\% and 90\% for gait identification and gesture recognition respectively, delivering consistently good performance - particularly when the problem size is significantly greater than that current approaches can effectively handle.},

  abstract = {Acoustic sensing is increasingly popular owing to widely available devices that support them. Yet the sensing resolution and range are still limited due to limited bandwidth and sharp decay in the signal at inaudible frequencies. Inspired by recent development in acoustic metasurfaces, in this paper, we first perform an in-depth study of acoustic metasurface (AMS) and compare it with the phased array speaker. Our results show that AMS is attractive as it achieves a significant SNR increase while maintaining a compact size. A major limitation of existing AMS is its static configuration. Since our target may be at any possible location, it is important to support scanning in different directions. We develop a novel acoustic system that leverages a metasurface and a small number of speakers. We jointly optimize the configuration of metasurface and transmission signals from the speakers to achieve low-cost dynamic steering. Using a prototype implementation and extensive evaluation, we demonstrate its effectiveness in improving SNR, acoustic sensing accuracy, and acoustic communication reliability over a wide range of scenarios.},

Nodes use known periodic schedules as base policies with which they can collaboratively learn how to transmit periodically in different time slots to limit packet collisions. The Adaptive Tree (AT) algorithm is introduced for this purpose, which results in AT-ALOHA. It is shown that nodes using AT-ALOHA quickly converge to transmission schedules that are virtually collision-free, and that the throughput of AT-ALOHA resembles that of TDMA, but without the need to define transmission frames with a given number of time slots. AT-ALOHA is shown to attain better throughput and fairness than slotted ALOHA with exponential back offs and ALOHA-Q (framed slotted ALOHA with Q learning).},

Yet 39\% of the rural US lacks broadband access, and most agriculture (ag) farms are not connected at all. To address the rural broadband challenge, we will develop the ARA rural wireless living lab.

Through this visioning article, we illustrate the community, application, economic, and operational contexts of rural wireless, the design of ARA, ARA-enabled research, and how ARA is expected to make rural broadband as affordable as urban broadband today.

Meanwhile, ambient backscatter communication is a promising solution to the Internet of Things (IoT), due to its high spectrum efficiency and power efficiency. In this paper, we are interested in a symbiotic system of cellular and IoT networks and propose a backscatter-NOMA system, which incorporates a downlink NOMA system with a backscatter device (BD). In the proposed system, the base station (BS) transmits information to two cellular users according to the NOMA protocol, while a BD transmits its information over the BS signals to one cellular user using the passive radio technology. In particular, if the BS only serves the cellular user that decodes BD information, the backscatter-NOMA system turns into a symbiotic radio (SR) system. We derive the expressions of the outage probabilities and the ergodic rates and analyze the corresponding diversity orders and slopes for both backscatter-NOMA and SR systems. Finally, we provide the numerical results to verify the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the interrelationship between the cellular networks and the IoT networks.},

Today, designing distributed circuits is a slow process that can take months from an expert engineer. Our model both automates and speeds up the process. The model learns to simulate the electromagnetic (EM) properties of distributed circuits. Hence, it can be used to replace traditional EM simulators, which typically take tens of minutes for each design iteration. Further, by leveraging neural networks' differentiability, we can use our model to solve the inverse problem -- i.e., given desirable EM specifications, we propagate the gradient to optimize the circuit parameters and topology to satisfy the specifications. We exploit the flexibility of GNN to create one model that works for different circuit topologies. We compare our model with a commercial simulator showing that it reduces simulation time by four orders of magnitude. We also demonstrate the value of our model by using it to design a Terahertz channelizer, a difficult task that requires a specialized expert. The results show that our model produces a channelizer whose performance is as good as a manually optimized design, and can save the expert several weeks of topology and parameter optimization. Most interestingly, our model comes up with new designs that differ from the limited templates commonly used by engineers in the field, hence significantly expanding the design space.},

  abstract = {The large antenna arrays with hybrid analog and digital (HAD) architectures can provide a large aperture with low cost and hardware complexity, resulting in enhanced direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation and reduced power consumption. This paper investigates the trade-off between DOA estimation and power consumption in large antenna arrays with HAD architectures. Particularly, the DOA estimation problem of fully-connected, sub-connected (SC), and switches-based (SE) hybrid architectures is formulated into a unified expression, with the compression matrix in a time-varying form. Based on this model, we derive a dynamic maximum likelihood (D-ML) estimator that is suitable for both HAD and conventional fully digital (FD) structures, and the closed-form expression of Cram{\'e}r-Rao bound (CRB) to evaluate the performance limit of the D-ML estimator for different HAD structures. The theoretical CRB analysis in the single-source case reveals that, the SC structure has the ability to achieve approximately the same performance as the FD structures at DOAs around zero, but suffers from the inherent angle ambiguity because of the antenna grouping. In addition, we propose a dynamic SC (D-SC) structure that is proved to eliminate the angle ambiguity with time-varying phase shifters, and a switch optimization (SWO) algorithm to minimize the CRB of SE structures. Finally, we introduce a new metric, DOA efficiency, to measure the trade-off between the DOA estimation performance and power consumption of different structures. Simulation results verify our theoretical analysis and the superiority of the proposed D-SC structure and the SWO algorithm.},

  abstract = {Mobile network is evolving from a communicationonly network towards one with joint communication and radar/radio sensing (JCAS) capabilities, that we call perceptive mobile network (PMN). Radio sensing here refers to information retrieval from received mobile signals for objects of interest in the environment surrounding the radio transceivers, and it may go beyond the functions of localization, tracking, and object recognition of traditional radar. In PMNs, JCAS integrates sensing into communications, sharing a majority of system modules and the same transmitted signals. The PMN is expected to provide a ubiquitous radio sensing platform and enable a vast number of novel smart applications, whilst providing non-compromised communications. In this paper, we present a broad picture of the motivation, methodologies, challenges, and research opportunities of realizing PMN, by providing a comprehensive survey for systems and technologies developed mainly in the last ten years. Beginning by reviewing the work on coexisting communication and radar systems, we highlight their limits on addressing the interference problem, and then introduce the JCAS technology. We then set up JCAS in the mobile network context and envisage its potential applications. We continue to provide a brief review of three types of JCAS systems, with particular attention to their differences in design philosophy. We then introduce a framework of PMN, including the system platform and infrastructure, three types of sensing operations, and signals usable for sensing. Subsequently, we discuss required system modifications to enable sensing on current communication-only infrastructure. Within the context of PMN, we review stimulating research problems and potential solutions, organized under nine topics: performance bounds, waveform optimization, antenna array design, clutter suppression, sensing parameter estimation, resolution of sensing ambiguity, pattern analysis, networked sensing under cellular topology, and sensing-assisted communications. We conclude the paper by listing key open research problems for the aforementioned topics and sharing some lessons that we have learned.},

  abstract = {Owing to dense deployment of light fixtures and multipath-free propagation, visible light localization technology holds potential to overcome the reliability issue of radio localization. However, existing visible light localization systems require customized light hardware, which increases deployment cost and hinders near term adoption. In this paper, we propose LiTell, a simple and robust localization scheme that employs unmodified fluorescent lights (FLs) as location landmarks and commodity smartphones as light sensors. LiTell builds on the key observation that each FL has an inherent characteristic frequency which can serve as a discriminative feature. It incorporates a set of sampling, signal amplification and camera optimization mechanisms, that enable a smartphone to capture the extremely weak and high frequency ( {$>$} 80 kHz) features. We have implemented LiTell as a real-time localization and navigation system on Android. Our experiments demonstrate LiTell's high reliability in discriminating different FLs, and its potential to achieve sub-meter location granularity. Our user study in a multi-storey office building, parking lot and grocery store further validates LiTell as an accurate, robust and ready-to-use indoor localization system.},

However, generating these maps in complex environments, such as multi-level parking garages or shopping malls, remains a formidable challenge. In this paper, we introduce a participatory sensing approach that delegates map-building tasks to map users, thereby enabling cost-effective and continuous data collection. The proposed method harnesses the collective efforts of users, facilitating the expansion and ongoing update of the maps as the environment evolves. We realized this approach by developing Map++, an efficient system that functions as a plug-and-play extension, supporting participatory map-building based on existing SLAM algorithms. Map++ addresses a plethora of scalability issues in this participatory map-building system by proposing a set of lightweight, application-layer protocols. We evaluated Map++ in four representative settings: an indoor garage, an outdoor plaza, a public SLAM benchmark, and a simulated environment. The results demonstrate that Map++ can reduce traffic volume by approximately 46\% with negligible degradation in mapping accuracy, i.e., less than 0.03m compared to the baseline system. It can support approximately 2{\texttimes} as many concurrent users as the baseline under the same network bandwidth. Additionally, for users who travel on already-mapped trajectories, they can directly utilize the existing maps for localization and save 47\% of the CPU usage.},

  abstract = {Radio frequency identification (RFID)-based localization and activity recognition have attracted much research attention recently. They rely on accurate measurements of signal features, e.g., phase and received signal strength (RSS), in line-of-sight (LOS) condition to estimate the location or activity status of the target objects. However, the LOS requirement might be frequently breached by obstacles between reader and tags in real deployed RFID systems. The resulting non-LOS (NLOS) signal will greatly reduce localization or activity recognition accuracy. How to filter out NLOS in the localization/activity recognition process is therefore practically important for guaranteeing accuracy. In this paper, we propose the first LOS/NLOS path recognition approach to differentiate the signals by LOS path from the ones by NLOS path. The proposed approach is both precise (with precision higher than 0.95) and real-time in nature (with recognition delay less than 400 ms) due to the following innovative designs. First, we design a new metric that can precisely distinguish LOS and NLOS paths by considering the joint variance of phase and RSS. Second, we propose an efficient method to mitigate the negative impacts of phase ambiguity on recognition precision. Third, we sample over a selected subset of channels and use only a handful of readings to perform LOS/NLOS path recognition, which greatly reduces the recognition delay without sacrificing precision. We conducted extensive experiments with commercial-off-the-shelf RFID devices. The results show that our approach achieves high precision and recall in all testing cases, with a precision of up to 0.969 and a recall of up to 0.991. Furthermore, our approach can also distinguish between different types of obstacles with an accuracy as high as 0.93.},

  abstract = {Human mobility is the foundation of urban dynamics and its prediction significantly benefits various downstream location-based services. Nowadays, while deep learning approaches are dominating the mobility prediction field where various model architectures/designs are continuously updating to push up the prediction accuracy, there naturally arises a question: whether these models are sufficiently good to reach the best possible prediction accuracy? To answer this question, predictability study is a method that quantifies the inherent regularities of the human mobility data and links the result to that limit. Mainstream predictability studies achieve this by analyzing the individual trajectories and merging all individual results to obtain an upper bound. However, the multiple individuals composing the city are not totally independent and the individual behavior is heavily influenced by its implicit or explicit surroundings. Therefore, the collective factor should be considered in the mobility predictability measurement, which has not been addressed before. This vision paper points out this concern and envisions a few potential research problems along such an individual-to-collective transition from both data and methodology aspects. We hope the discussion in this paper sheds some light on the human mobility predictability community.},

In this paper, we propose Pulsar, which uses a compact photodiode sensor, readily fit into a mobile device, to discriminate existing ceiling lights---either fluorescent lights or conventional LEDs---based on their intrinsic optical emission features. To overcome the photodiode's lack of spatial resolution, we design a novel sparse photogrammetry mechanism, which resolves the light source's angle-of-arrival, and triangulates the device's 3D location and even orientation. To facilitate ubiquitous deployment, we further develop a light registration mechanism that automatically registers the ceiling lights' locations as landmarks on a building's floor map. Our experiments demonstrate that Pulsar can reliably achieve decimeter precision in both controlled environment and large-scale buildings.},

However, the proposed solutions mostly consider single-person scenarios, whereas a few multi-person monitoring proposals simply apply blind source separation to handle inter-person interference, without drawing a clear line between physical and algorithmic separability. In this paper, we set out to answer: under what condition(s) one may physically separate multiple respiration signals sensed by diversified RF technologies? Drawing inspiration from conventional signal processing, we propose respiration-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (RINR) as a novel metric, taking into account the impact from both background noise and various interfering sources. Instead of attenuation in Euclidean distance, RINR has to be evaluated upon range/angle bins where physical separation actually take place. As signal attenuation has never been modeled in this manner, we rise to this challenge by levering a deep learning model to fit a spread function upon range/angle bins. The resulting RINR model allows us to concretely indicate the limit of physical separability of RF-based multi-person respiration monitoring. Our extensive experiments firmly validate the RINR model, thus evidently demonstrating the benefits of employing RINR model as a guideline for conducting respiration monitoring with different RF technologies.},

Contact-free wireless sensing has been successfully demonstrated using various RF signals such as WiFi, RFID, LoRa, and mmWave, enabling a large range of applications. However, limited by hardware thermal noise, the granularity of RF sensing is still relatively coarse. In this paper, instead of using the macro signal power/phase for sensing, we propose the first quantum wireless sensing system, which uses the micro energy level of atoms for sensing, improving the sensing granularity by an order of magnitude. The proposed quantum wireless sensing system is capable of utilizing a wide spectrum of frequencies (e.g., 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz and 28 GHz) for sensing. We demonstrate the superior performance of quantum wireless sensing with two widely-used signals, i.e., WiFi and 28 GHz millimeter wave. We show that quantum wireless sensing can push the sensing granularity of WiFi from millimeter level to sub-millimeter level and push the sensing granularity of millimeter wave to micrometer level.},

  abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the emerging development of single-antenna wireless respiration detection that can be integrated into IoT devices with a single transceiver chain. However, existing single-antenna-based solutions are all limited by the short sensing range within 2-4 m due to noise interference, which makes them difficult to be adopted in most room-scale scenarios. To deal with this dilemma, we propose a room-scale, noise-resistance, and accurate respiration monitoring system, named               Wi-Cyclops               ,                                1                              which captures CSI changes induced by respiratory movements only via one antenna on commercial WiFi devices. To push the limits of effective sensing distance, we innovatively supply a new perspective to review the CSI samples along the sub-carrier dimension. From this dimension, we find that the interrelationship between sub-carriers with different timestamps still shows a high correlation even though the SNR decreases. Based on that, we analyze the noise characteristics along the sub-carrier dimension and correspondingly design a series of denoising schemes. Specifically, we carefully design a PCA-based denoising method to filter out ambient noises. After that, considering the low distribution densities of the AGC-induced noise, we then remove it by optimizing the DBSCAN denoising method with the K-Means-based adaptive radius search. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system can work effectively in three typical family scenarios.               Wi-Cyclops               can achieve 98\% accuracy even when the person is 7 m away from the transceiver pair. Compared with the start-of-art single-antenna-based approaches in real scenarios,               Wi-Cyclops               can improve the sensing range from 3 m to 7 m, which can meet the requirements of room-scale respiration monitoring. Additionally, to show the high compatibility with smart home devices,               Wi-Cyclops               is deployed on seven commercial IoT devices and still achieves a low average absolute error with 0.41 bpm.},

  abstract = {Assistive robotic arms often have more degrees-offreedom than a human teleoperator can control with a lowdimensional input, like a joystick. To overcome this challenge, existing approaches use data-driven methods to learn a mapping from low-dimensional human inputs to high-dimensional robot actions. However, determining if such a black-box mapping can confidently infer a user's intended high-dimensional action from low-dimensional inputs remains an open problem. Our key idea is to adapt the assistive map at training time to additionally estimate high-dimensional action quantiles, and then calibrate these quantiles via rigorous uncertainty quantification methods. Specifically, we leverage adaptive conformal prediction which adjusts the intervals over time, reducing the uncertainty bounds when the mapping is performant and increasing the bounds when the mapping consistently mis-predicts. Furthermore, we propose an uncertainty-interval-based mechanism for detecting highuncertainty user inputs and robot states. We evaluate the efficacy of our proposed approach in a 2D assistive navigation task and two 7DOF Kinova Jaco tasks involving assistive cup grasping and goal reaching. Our findings demonstrate that conformalized assistive teleoperation manages to detect (but not differentiate between) high uncertainty induced by diverse preferences and induced by low-precision trajectories in the mapping's training dataset. On the whole, we see this work as a key step towards enabling robots to quantify their own uncertainty and proactively seek intervention when needed.},

  abstract = {Millimeter-wave (mmWave) technologies represent a cornerstone for emerging wireless network infrastructure, and for RF sensing systems in security, health, and automotive domains. Through a MIMO array of phased arrays with hundreds of antenna elements, mmWave can boost wireless bit-rates to 100+ Gbps, and potentially achieve near-vision sensing resolution. However, the lack of an experimental platform has been impeding research in this field. We propose to fill the gap with M3 (M-Cube), the first mmWave massive MIMO software radio. M3 features a fully reconfigurable array of phased arrays, with up to 8 RF chains and 256 antenna elements. Despite the orders of magnitude larger antenna arrays, its cost is orders of magnitude lower, even when compared with state-of-the-art single RF chain mmWave software radios. In this demo, we will show M3's hardware modules, and demonstrate its usage in mmWave MIMO communication and sensing.},

  abstract = {Although Maxwell discovered the physical laws of electromagnetic waves 160 years ago, how to precisely model the propagation of an RF signal in an electrically large and complex environment remains a long-standing problem. The difficulty is in the complex interactions between the RF signal and the obstacles (e.g., reflection, diffraction, etc.). Inspired by the great success of using a neural network to describe the optical field in computer vision, we propose a neural radio-frequency radiance field, NeRF2, which represents a continuous volumetric scene function that makes sense of an RF signal's propagation. Particularly, after training with a few signal measurements, NeRF2 can tell how/what signal is received at any position when it knows the position of a transmitter. As a physical-layer neural network, NeRF2 can take advantage of the learned statistic model plus the physical model of ray tracing to generate a synthetic dataset that meets the training demands of application-layer artificial neural networks (ANNs). Thus, we can boost the performance of ANNs by the proposed turbo-learning, which mixes the true and synthetic datasets to intensify the training. Our experiment results show that turbo-learning can enhance performance with an approximate 50\% increase. We also demonstrate the power of NeRF2 in the field of indoor localization and 5G MIMO.},

The key RF-Mehndi novelty is that when the user's fingertip touching on the tag array surface during the communication, the backscattered signals by the tag array become user-dependent and unique. Hence, if we enhance the communication modality of many personal cards nowadays by RF-Mehndi, in case that a card gets lost or stolen, it cannot be used illegally by the adversaries. To harvest such a benefit, we have two key observations in designing RF-Mehndi. The first observation is when tags are nearby, their interrogated currents can change each other's circuit characteristics, based on which unique phase features can be obtained from backscattered signals. The second observation is that when the user's fingertip touches the tag array surface during communication, the phase feature can be further profiled by this user. Based on these observations, the card and its holder can be potentially authenticated at the same time. To transfer the RF-Mehndi idea to a practical system, we further address technical challenges. We implement a prototype system. Extensive evaluations show the effectiveness of RF-Mehndi, achieving excellent authentication performance.},

Our meshes are dynamic and smoothly track the movements of the corresponding people. Further, our model works both in single and multi-person scenarios. Inferring body meshes from radio signals is a highly under-constrained problem. Our model deals with this challenge using: 1) a combination of strong and weak supervision, 2) a multi-headed self-attention mechanism that attends differently to temporal information in the radio signal, and 3) an adversarially trained temporal discriminator that imposes a prior on the dynamics of human motion. Our results show that RF-Avatar accurately recovers dynamic 3D meshes in the presence of occlusions, baggy clothes, bad lighting conditions, and even through walls.},

When the network is trained, the Maxwell's equations and the associated initial and boundary conditions are set as constraint conditions, and the iterative calculation of electromagnetic (EM) field is transformed into the optimal training of the model, which can realize high-precision prediction of electromagnetic field with fewer neural network layers and neurons. To verify the implementation of the algorithm, the results of the proposed method are compared with those of the analytical solution. The experimental results show that the proposed method can predict the complex behavior of Maxwell's equations accurately, which proves the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed method.},

Even worse, such location information is always public as it is the basic information of businesses, and adversaries could be anyone ranging from advertisement spammer to physical stalker. This paper formalizes the privacy preserving problem in local business service systems and propose a novel location privacy preserving framework. The framework can preserve users' location privacy in arbitrary local area and can maintain a good utility for both the system and every user. We evaluate our framework thoroughly towards real-world data traces. The results validate that the framework can achieve a good performance.},

The time-domain electric field integral equation (TD-EFIE) technique has been employed to analyze electromagnetic scattering and radiation problems from thin wire structures. However, the most popular method to solve the TD-EFIE is typically the marching-on in time (MOT) method, which sometimes may suffer from its late-time instability. Instead, we solve the time-domain integral equation by expressing the transient behaviors in terms of weighted Laguerre polynomials. By using these orthonormal basis functions for the temporal variation, the time derivatives can be handled analytically and stable results can be obtained even for late-time. Furthermore, the excitation source in most scattering and radiation analysis of electromagnetic systems is typically done using a Gaussian shaped pulse. In this paper, both a Gaussian pulse and other waveshapes like a rectangular pulse or a ramp like function have been used as excitations for the scattering and radiation of thin-wire antennas with and without junctions. The time-domain results are compared with the inverse discrete Fourier transform (IDFT) of a frequency domain analysis.},

  abstract = {最近提出的OFDMA反向散射可以提高基于OFDM的反向散射系统的并发性和频谱分配灵活性。然而，我们发现现有设计在原型设计中扩展效率非常低：它需要逐个离线计算来获得标签的工作参数，以确保系统中子载波之间的正交性;此外，在分配多个子载波之前，必须对标签硬件进行专用的离线修改。效率低下是由标签的当前模拟频率合成设计引起的。本文提出一种实现数字频率合成的OFDMA反向散射系统DigiScatter，为大规模OFDMA反向散射网络提供一种高效的原型设计方法。在DigiScatter中，我们首次将IDFT集成到标签设计中;如此简单而有效的改进，使系统能够通过纯软件配置在线方式支持高并发和灵活的频谱资源分配。我们构建原型并进行全面实验以验证我们的设计。DigiScatter在物理上分别实现2.4GHz和900MHz的100和300并发OFDMA反向散射传输，并提供频率合成能力，支持1019并发传输。},

To incorporate EM laws into designing procedures of the physical layer, we first propose the novel concept of EM physical layer, whose backbone theory is called EM information theory (EIT). In this article, we systematically investigate the basic ideas and main results of EIT. First, we review the fundamental analytical tools of classical information theory and EM theory. Then, we introduce the modeling and analysis methodologies of EIT, including continuous field modeling, degrees of freedom, and mutual information analyses. Several EIT-inspired applications are discussed to illustrate how EIT guides the design of practical wireless systems. Finally, we point out the open problems of EIT, where further research efforts are required for EIT to construct a unified interdisciplinary theory.},

  abstract = {The rapid growth of intelligent sensing capabilities and super computation power in 6G mobile communication systems has facilitated their application in diverse domains such as smart health, smart factories, and the industrial Internet of Things. Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC), as a core technology, has merged with artificial intelligence (AI) to enable intelligent connectivity, leading to a paradigm shift in traditional communication modes. This paper presents a visionary design for an ISAC-oriented unified IoT architecture that integrates software-defined communication and super-intelligent agents. By leveraging dynamic adaptability, self-learning, and optimization, the ISAC system can intelligently and flexibly respond to evolving requirements and environments. The architecture is redefined into three layers: the hardware layer, the omniscient layer, and the application layer. Furthermore, a retrospective survey of ISAC technology development over the past decade is conducted, highlighting new design principles for AI-empowered networks and multi-modals that support ``intelligent connectivity'' across various application scenarios and reinforce the security of ISAC. This paper categorizes the related works according to the different layer structures of the proposed architecture, and some important physical and machine learning models are introduced. Additionally, we summarize the current technological bottlenecks associated with ISAC and propose future research directions and potential solutions that lay the foundation for the future development of secure and intelligent communication networks.},

The locally most powerful detector and the corresponding optimal waveform based on maximizing the detector's performance under a small-signal assumption are derived. The performance is evaluated analytically, and numerically compared with that of the mutual information based method. The locally most powerful detection metric is shown to be the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The use of the latter measure leads to a substantial performance improvement. Moreover, a useful relationship among the three existing waveform design metrics, namely the output signal-to-noise ratio, the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and the mutual information, is provided. It explains the tradeoffs of the various metrics currently used for radar waveform design.},

  abstract = {WiFi technology has gained a wide prevalence for not only wireless communication but also pervasive sensing. A wide variety of emerging applications leverage accurate measurements of the Channel State Information (CSI) information obtained from commodity WiFi devices. Due to hardware imperfection of commodity WiFi devices, the frequency response of internal signal processing circuit is mixed with the real channel frequency response in passband, which makes deriving accurate channel frequency response from CSI measurements a challenging task. In this paper, we identify non-negligible non-linear CSI phase errors and report that IQ imbalance is the root source of non-linear CSI phase errors. We conduct intensive analysis on the characteristics of such non-linear errors and find that such errors are prevalent among various WiFi devices. Furthermore, they are rather stable along time and the received signal strength indication (RSSI) but sensitive to frequency bands used between a transmission pair. Based on these key observations, we propose new methods to compensate both non-linear and linear CSI phase errors. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods by applying them in CSI splicing and indoor distance ranging. Results of extensive real-world experiments indicate that accurate CSI phase measurements can significantly improve the performance of splicing and the stability of the derived power delay profiles (PDPs). Moreover, the estimated distance errors are reduced by 5.7 times on average comparing to the state-of-the-art schemes.},

  abstract = {RFID sensing leveraging backscatter signal features (e.g., phase shift) from tags has gained increasing popularity in numerous applications, but also suffers from negative impacts of environmental multipaths. Past works to address it rely on extra customized devices, labor-intensive offline training or frequency channel hopping, all of which are non-ubiquitous or ineffective for real-life adoption. This paper presents RoSense, a universal method to alleviate multipath reflections' impacts by spinning the reader antenna, thus enabling more robust RFID sensing. Besides, RoSense requires no RF devices or offline training, and operates in a non-intrusive manner. The key insight of RoSense is to exploit two properties of line-of-sight (LOS) signal when spinning the antenna, i.e., the linearity of phase changes and stability of received signal strength to attenuate the non-linear and non-monotonic effect of multipath signals and refine the phase shift of LOS signal. We have implemented a prototype of RoSense with COTS devices and studied two cases for evaluation: material identification and object localization. Experimental results show that RoSense can improve the material identification accuracy by up to 16.22\% and reduce the mean localization error by up to 39.93\%, greatly outperforming the state-of-the-art solutions.},

By combining this definition with a rotation-invariant shape descriptor, we show how it is possible to describe a curve in an intrinsically affine-invariant manner. To validate our procedure we built a database of shapes subject to perspective distortions and plotted the precision-recall curve for this dataset. Finally an application of our method is shown in the context of wide baseline matching.},
